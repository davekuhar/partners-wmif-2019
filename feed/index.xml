<p class="" data-reactid="283">by WBUR</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="283">June 8, 2018- So far, the digital revolution has mostly been a disappointment in health care. Doctors stare at their screens instead of us. Specialists and emergency rooms still don’t have all our records.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="284">But artificial intelligence, big data analytics and deep learning are converging on health care in a big way, information technology experts insist. The changes have already begun. And if and when they really take off, such convergence of biology and technology should bring about a complete transformation of medical care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="286">“My personal perspective would be in three to five years, the huge majority of patients will be touched one way or [an]other with some AI-related system, whether they know it or not,” says Chris Coburn, chief innovation officer at Partners HealthCare, who recently led a three-day conference on the topic of artificial intelligence, or AI. “The scope of the potential benefit is at times not easily even imagined.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="287">Coburn and others cite numerous examples where artificial intelligence is already improving health care:</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="288">&#8212; Digital visual analysis is beginning to replace pathologists at identifying dangerous tumors.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="289">&#8212; Devices are increasingly able to monitor patients at home to catch problems before they become serious.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="290">&#8212; Pharmaceutical companies like Amgen and Novartis are using deep learning and artificial intelligence to shorten their drug development process and improve their odds of successfully bringing a drug to market.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="291">&#8212; Cellphones and watch-like mobile devices are increasingly being used to monitor healthy people for changes that might indicate impending problems.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="292">&#8212; And in hospitals, algorithms can help indicate which patients need immediate attention and which should be left alone to rest.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="293">&#8220;Our patient monitoring and guardian algorithms can actually predictively say how a patient is doing,&#8221; says Frans van Houten, head of Royal Philips, the Dutch conglomerate now focused almost entirely on health care technologies.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="294">Houten, whose company is in the process of consolidating its U.S. research operations in Cambridge, says digital algorithms can predict which patients are vulnerable to life-threatening infections and which to heart attacks.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="295">“And that allows the health system to proactively direct staff to the patients that need [care], versus the patients that don’t,” he says. “So our technology can play a big role for precision care and raising productivity.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="296">Similarly, Colin Hill runs a Cambridge company, GNS Healthcare, which analyzes vast amounts of patient data to derive information that can improve care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="297">“We’re on a path to turning the lights on and revealing what works for whom,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And by getting at the underlying mechanisms of these diseases, we can now stop the guesswork. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s really exciting for me.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="298">His company recently used genetic data from a large number of patients with the blood cancer multiple myeloma to identify patterns in those who were helped by a costly, potentially dangerous bone marrow transplant. If the findings are validated, patients whose genetics suggest they wouldn’t benefit could be spared the time, energy, expense and dashed hopes of a fruitless procedure.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="299">Thanks to improvements in artificial intelligence, Hill says, “we’re now able to learn that kind of causality &#8212; those kinds of cause-effect relationships &#8212; straight from real-world data.”</p>
</section>
<section class="article-section--content hang-punctuation article-section--island" data-reactid="300">
<blockquote class="article-pullquote" data-reactid="301">
<p class="article-pullquote-text" data-reactid="302">&#8220;As a society, we are coming to grips with the fact that we have a health care system that costs far too much and delivers far too little&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><cite class="article-pullquote-attribution" data-reactid="304">Colin Hill, GNS Healthcare</cite></p></blockquote>
</section>
<section class="article-section--content hang-punctuation article-section--centered" data-reactid="305">
<p class="" data-reactid="306">Hopefully, this will also save money, which is driving the current interest, Hill says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="307">“What&#8217;s changed is the convergence of both the data and the technology capabilities,” he says. “And I think the environment&#8217;s also changed. As a society, we are coming to grips with the fact that we have a health care system that costs far too much and delivers far too little and it is ultimately not sustainable the way it is.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="308">Nobel Laureate and MIT Institute professor Phil Sharp has an even broader vision of this convergence: It’s not just computer science and biology that are converging, but engineering, physics, material science and agriculture too, he says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="309">“Life science is part of all of those processes and bringing physicists and engineering and information technology together to integrate life science with the translation to solving those problems is what convergence is about,” Sharp says. “It&#8217;ll be decades of exciting science and exciting technology.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="310"><strong>&#8216;It Doesn&#8217;t Always Go The Way We Hope&#8217;</strong></p>
<p class="" data-reactid="311">Despite its potential, some people say that artificial intelligence is the future of health care — and always will be. Skepticism remains high because of problems with the electronic health record, which has taken years longer than expected to become functional and constructive.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="312">“We hope that things are going to go well. But specifically in health care it doesn&#8217;t always go the way we hope,” says Andrew Beam, an instructor and junior faculty member in the department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="313">GNS Healthcare&#8217;s Hill says he finds it annoying when tech people assume it should be easy to bring change to health care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="314">&#8220;When folks come from the tech world thinking that they&#8217;re going to come and build the iPhone of human disease and health care, one of the reasons why they stumble with it is because the complexity of these systems is just beyond anything we&#8217;ve dealt with,” Hill says. &#8220;It’s a fundamentally different problem.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="315">There is no room for error when someone’s health or life is on the line.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="316">And privacy is an even bigger issue in medicine than on social media. No one wants their medical records on display on the internet.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="317">Beam says that although there is more oversight in medicine, privacy breaches will happen.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="318">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to continue to be a problem,” he says. &#8220;The unfortunate fact in cybersecurity is that the bad guys are always just ahead of the good guys and there&#8217;s sort of an ongoing arms race.&#8221;</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="319">Despite the concerns about digital health, there’s clearly a growing interest in the combination of computer technology and medical care.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="320">Abbie Celniker, a partner Third Rock Ventures, says so far, her venture capital firm hasn’t invested directly in artificial intelligence or machine learning companies. But that day may not be far off.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="321">“We are starting to really do our homework and think about the most optimal places to bring together therapeutic development and digital health,” she says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="322">Others are investing, too. Last month, pharma giant Roche <a href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180216/NEWS/180219932">spent $1.9 billion</a> to buy Flatiron Health, a New York startup that tries to advance cancer care by analyzing huge datasets of patient records.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="323">Celniker says that most of the companies Third Rock has helped start already use digital technologies to analyze datasets, crunch numbers or improve efficiency.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="324">“But applying it in a bigger way, bringing together more diverse datasets, and having things learned from those very diverse datasets, that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re just trying now to figure out where&#8217;s the best place to investigate,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="325">Greater Boston has all the necessary ingredients to lead in the area of digital health, a number of local experts say, continuing to keep the so-called BioBoom alive for years to come.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="326">“Digital health is what&#8217;s next. Precision medicine, personalized medicine &#8212; that is what&#8217;s next,” says Bob Coughlin, president and CEO of the nonprofit Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. “Now let&#8217;s ask, where is most of that research in those areas — in digital health and precision medicine? What in gene therapy and immunotherapy and gene modification and exon skipping and CAR-T therapy, CRISPR technology &#8212; where’s most of that happening? Well, folks, you can walk to it right here.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="327">Although digital giants like Microsoft and Google are headquartered in Silicon Valley, they now have outposts in Cambridge. They’re the ones driving up the rent in Kendall Square, Coughlin says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="328">And there’s a broad range of expertise here, which will be essential for this convergence, Harvard Med&#8217;s Beam says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="329">&#8220;You can&#8217;t just be a computer scientist working in isolation on artificial intelligence if you want to change biology and medicine,” he says. You have to partner with doctors, engineers and hospital staff. “And no matter what area of biology or medicine would like you to use AI to improve, there is a world expert in that area here Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p class="speakable-paragraph">To fix or to reinvent?  That’s the question many would-be innovators ask as they contemplate potential applications of technology to health.</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist and Senior Investigator with the legendary TIMI Study Group at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s (BWH) hospital, nicely represents the views of what might be called the “fix it” folks. At a recent panel discussion at the World Medical Innovation Forum (viewable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snd0X0c_qSg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snd0X0c_qSg">here</a>), Wiviott noted how expensive traditional randomized clinical trials (RCTs) can be, telling the audience that the cardiovascular (CV) outcome trial he’s now running for an SGLT2 medication involves the recruitment of 17,000 patients, will take seven years to complete, and will cost about half a billion (with a “b”) dollars.  He suspects that it shouldn’t need to cost nearly that much, and that improved regulations in particular, as well as improving efficiencies at each step of the trial (potentially with the help of data and technology) could take 90% of the cost out of the current system.</p>

<h2>Recap | April 25</h2>
<p><strong>World Medical Innovation Forum: Artificial Intelligence</strong><br />
<em>1,700 registrants, 140 executive presenters and key leaders shape the future of artificial intelligence!</em></p>
<p>The third day of the World Medical Innovation Forum featured a series of panel discussions and fireside chats that focused on ways that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve the performance and data-gathering capabilities of medical devices, reduce health care costs, improve operational efficiencies across the healthcare system and mine new insights from clinical and research data.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the magnitude of the information we have available to us in this space, you think about where technology is today and the compute horsepower that is available to all of us, it just makes sense to continue to evaluate technologies like artificial intelligence to be able to streamline not just operational and administrative efficiency, but be able to make more informed and timely decisions,&#8221; said Eric Murphy, CEO of OptumInsight and Enterprise Growth Officer at Optum, during a discussion on how AI technologies could factor into healthcare reimbursement systems.</p>
<p>Another engaging discussion focused on the concerns that AI technologies may eventually replace human pathologists and radiologists in diagnosing patients. The message from the speakers on this panel was that AI tools should be viewed as a friend, not a foe.</p>
<p>Constance Lehman, MD, PhD, Chief of Breast Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), said AI technologies have helped make imaging services at MGH more precise, targeted and personalized while reducing repetitive tasks that lead to burnout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a doubt this is on the friend side and a really powerful technology,&#8221; said Andrew Beck, MD, PhD, CEO, of PathAI. &#8220;The types of problems we are interested in solving are really hard and big and we&#8217;re very far from being able to effectively solve them, even with the AI of today. We&#8217;re very lucky that we have the access to these new technologies that will assist the profession.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s Fireside Chat sessions provided valuable insights from healthcare leaders in the government, technology and pharmaceutical sectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in this industry for nearly four decades now. I honestly believe that I have never seen a technology that&#8217;s as transformative as this one,&#8221; said John Kelly, PhD, Senior Vice President for Cognitive Solutions and Research at IBM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity is enormous to transform this industry for better outcomes, lower costs for the benefit of all,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s now into the hard work portion of this. It is not easy to build a very intelligent, at scale, precise artificial intelligence system to be injected in the workflow of a clinical physician or a drug researcher. That is a big job. And by the way, you better have heck of a lot of good data to train that system.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Disruptive Dozen: 12 AI Technologies That Will Reinvent Care</h2>
<p>The forum concluded on Wednesday afternoon with the presentation of the Disruptive Dozen, 12 technologies that faculty members in the Partners HealthCare System (PHS) believe have the potential to significantly advance healthcare in the next decade.</p>

<h2>First Look Winners Announced!</h2>
<p>Congratulations to First Look presenters Sabine Wilhelm, PhD, from MGH and Ziad Obermeyer, MD, from Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) for winning the Peter K. Ranney Innovation Award!</p>
<p>The award was presented at last night&#8217;s Innovator&#8217;s Dinner to honor the BWH and MGH First Look presenters who embodied the innovative, entrepreneurial and visionary spirit the World Medical Innovation Forum was established to recognize.</p>
<p>Here is some of the feedback the judges provided for the winners:</p>
<h5><em>Mobile Apps: Bridging the Mental Health Treatment Gap</em></h5>
<p><strong>Sabine Wilhelm, PhD</strong><br />
The concept of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy through a mobile app reduces traditional barriers to mental health treatment and tackles cost and access issues head on.<br />
Given the well demonstrated market need for better mental health care paradigms and relative maturity of the technology, the app may benefit from a potentially short commercialization timeline.<br />
The app is well positioned to passively collect substantial data that can inform computational models used to personalize treatment and provide real-time interventions.</p>
<h5><em>A Machine Learning Algorithm to Reduce Costs and Increase Quality</em></h5>
<p><strong>Ziad Obermeyer, MD</strong><br />
The presentation addressed the kind of multi-variate clinical challenges that AI/ML based approaches are well suited to address.<br />
The research has potential for dramatic impact on both cost and quality.<br />
There is real opportunity to expand the approach across clinical domains and disease conditions-a big idea with the potential for broad impact.</p>

<h2>Recap | April 24</h2>
<p><strong>The Role of AI in Health Care Accessibility and Drug Discovery</strong><br />
<em>A closer look at how to turn the promise of implementing AI in health care into a reality.</em></p>
<p>Day 2 of the World Medical Innovation Forum was packed with in-depth discussions on the opportunities and challenges of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the health care system, with an up-close look at the role AI could play in delivering affordable health care, supporting clinical decision making, processing large amounts of data and speeding up drug development.</p>
<p>The discussion also highlighted some key challenges in AI integration, such as convincing clinicians, patients and payors of the value of AI technology, standardizing data across platforms, and protecting patient privacy in a digitized world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4332" src="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="267" srcset="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12.jpg 800w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-300x100.jpg 300w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-768x256.jpg 768w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-220x73.jpg 220w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-180x60.jpg 180w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-140x47.jpg 140w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Importance of Data</h2>
<p>Data collection was a key topic in many sessions throughout the day. &#8220;The theme you will hear over and over is very high quality, well-curated data,&#8221; said Mark Murcko, PhD, Chief Science Officer of Relay Therapeutics, during a session on drug development. &#8220;One of the big challenges we have is to better represent the interactions that molecules are having. Just to tease out that little bit of insight that helps the drug discovery team move a little faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>A panel discussion on Data Engineering in Health Care emphasized the importance of engaging patients in discovery process and convincing them that the benefits of sharing their health information with clinicians and researchers outweigh the risks of a potential data breach.</p>
<p>James Mault, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for Qualcomm Life, noted that 15 years ago many people were hesitant about using their credit cards to make purchases online, but today nearly everyone has their information stored on website such as Amazon because of the convenience it provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is still there, but we&#8217;re willing to accept that risk because we&#8217;re getting these tremendous benefits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In health care we&#8217;re seeing a lot of risk, but we&#8217;re not yet seeing a lot of benefit.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Day 2 also featured a series of one-on-one fireside chats. Atul Gawande, MD, a surgeon at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) and bestselling author of Being Mortal and The Checklist Manifesto (among others), told Brigham Health President Elizabeth Nabel, MD, that the key to successfully integrating AI technology into clinical care is to identify clear benefits for both the patient and the clinician-and to ensure that the health care providers are ready and willing to use it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you give people a great process solution, the perfect innovation tool, and plug it into a ready environment, you make a major impact.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Afternoon Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>In a panel session on AI and Genetic Sequencing, moderator Heidi Rehm, PhD, said that while researchers are now able to collect much more genetic data from patients, their ability to process and take action on that data is still lagging behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team in my laboratory still reads articles in the literature to try to figure out what these variants mean,&#8221; Rehm said. &#8220;We will never be able to disseminate these technologies for broad medical use if we can&#8217;t advance what we are doing today in terms of understanding the genetic and genomic variation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the concerns raised and the work that still needs to be done, the tone of the day&#8217;s sessions were overwhelming positive, with nearly all participants saying they believed that AI technology could make significant improvements in the delivery of health care.</p>
<p>In a CEO roundtable discussion hosted by Peter Slavin, MD, President of Massachusetts General Hospital, Terri Bresenham, Chief Executive Officer for GE Healthcare, shared her optimistic outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very bullish,&#8221; Bresenham said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s no doubt that this will be by far the most transformational technology change that is going to occur, in concert with some other very important changes in genomics and genetics and biotherapies as well as diagnostics and imaging technology.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Recap | April 23</h2>
<p><strong>A Sell Out Crowd</strong></p>
<p>The fourth annual World Medical Innovation Forum (WMIF) sponsored by Partners Innovation, kicked off Monday morning with a record attendance of 1,600 participants representing the top healthcare, biotech and venture capital firms from across the globe.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s forum is Artificial Intelligence (AI), and much of the discussion on Day One focused on the promise, complexities and limitations of AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>Speakers were optimistic about the potential for AI to drive big improvements in predicting disease, treating patients and managing outcomes, but also cautioned that the technology is still in its early stages and there will likely be some growing pains along the way.</p>
<p>In her opening remarks, Anne Klibanski, MD, Chief Academic Officer of the Partners HealthCare system (PHS), noted that PHS has been investing in the large-scale aggregation and collection of clinical data that can be used to power AI technologies, and is well position to serve as an AI hub with collaborators worldwide.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker was impressed by the speakers and participants at the forum. &#8220;This is what I call rock star city,&#8221; Baker said in his opening remarks. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such a terrific collection of intellectual capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>First Look: Next Wave of AI Breakthroughs</h2>
<p>In what has become a must-see event to kick off the forum, Monday&#8217;s First Look Session provided attendees with a look at 19 new innovations in AI-powered medical applications from investigators in the PHS system.</p>
<p>The depth and breadth of applications was impressive, including innovations in psychiatry, surgery, genetic profiling, in vitro fertilization, predicting C. difficile infection rates and blood group typing, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Ziad Obermeyer, MD, an emergency medicine clinician at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH), presented a concept for using machine learning algorithm to improve the decision making process for costly medical tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing errors on both sides,&#8221; Dr. Obermeyer explained. &#8220;Predictably low risk patients are getting tested and predictability high risk patients are not getting tested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing clear to me is that anything would be better than what we are doing today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t come as a surprise to anyone that doctors make mistakes, but we can use these algorithms to find out where and with whom those doctors make mistakes. Building on this understanding, you can come to a whole range of possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Hashimoto, MD, a surgical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), presented on a system called &#8220;Surgical Fingerprints&#8221; that is designed to reduce the risk of adverse intra-operative events by collecting data from previous surgeries and using that information to guide real-time decision making in the operating room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like [the popular direction-finding app] Waze for surgery, but instead of avoiding traffic, it will allow you to avoid surgical complications,&#8221; Hashimoto explained.</p>
<h2>Discovery Café Workshops</h2>
<p>Following the First Look event, the crowd broke out into smaller groups for a series of Discovery Café Sessions taking a closer look at the potential for AI in pathology, anesthesiology, neurosciences, data security and the workforce.</p>
<p>In the neurosciences session, Maurizio Fava, MD, director of the Division of Clinical Research at MGH and the vice chair of the MGH Department of Psychiatry, noted that 20 percent of clinical trial participants never actually take the drug that is being tested,. Fava said he was hopeful that AI technology could help to identify and screen out those participants to improve the accuracy of results.</p>

<h2>Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>Monday afternoon&#8217;s panel sessions began with a big picture view of AI in healthcare before digging deeper into specific areas of interest, such as the role of AI in drug development; the interaction of AI with electronic health records and the role of AI in improving clinical trials.</p>
<p>Tom Lynch, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Bristol Myers Squibb, was optimistic that AI could help to streamline the movement of new molecules from discovery to development. The current process &#8220;takes way too long and costs way too much,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Health IT Analytics</p>
<p><time datetime="2018-3-21">March 21, 2018</time> &#8211; Despite the fact that the healthcare industry hit its EHR saturation point some time ago, providers and vendors are still eagerly engaged in dialogue about the utilization and continued optimization of health IT tools.</p>
<p>But the topics of debate have shifted away from how to become a digital enterprise and towards something bigger and more visionary: <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/how-healthcare-can-prep-for-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning">how to use</a> an organization’s growing data assets to measurably impact cost, patient-provider experiences, and the quality of care.</p>
<p>No discussion of these critical issues would be complete without at least a passing mention of machine learning and artificial intelligence – and for many organizations, including Partners Healthcare, these emerging strategies are at the center of the conversation.</p>
<p>“Artificial intelligence will have succeeded when we no longer talk about it,” said Mark Michalski, MD, Executive Director of the MGH &amp; BWH Center for Clinical Data Science.  “The health system will simply be smarter and better without the need to distinguish it from anything else.”</p>
<p>“But for now, it’s something that we do need to talk about because there’s so much to discover and so many opportunities to refine our thinking and our approaches.”</p>
<p>Partners Healthcare, which includes notable facilities such as Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is taking a leading role as a convener of those conversations by hosting the <a href="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/">World Medical Innovation Forum on Artificial Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>The three-day event, held in Boston on April 23-25, 2018, will bring Partners experts, Harvard Medical School faculty, and numerous luminaries from the developer and vendor community to set the expectations and potential for AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>“We are at this very exciting pivot point in healthcare, and AI is a catalyst accelerating the industry’s transformation,” says Partners Healthcare Chief Information Officer Christopher Coburn. “It isn’t going to take long at all for the effects of AI to spread across all of healthcare.”</p>
<p>Many medical disciplines are already feeling those effects, agreed Michalski.  A radiologist by training, he is keenly aware that artificial intelligence is already becoming a force to be reckoned with in image-based specialties.</p>
<p>“Machine learning has <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/ai-for-imaging-analytics-intrigues-healthcare-orgs-yet-starts-slow">tremendous promise</a> for diagnostics, including in my field of radiology,” he told <em>HealthITAnalytics.com</em>.  “It is very good at processing images, and characterizing the features in those images, to make radiologists more efficient and help them make their reports more quantitative and useful for the patients they serve.”</p>
<p>However, these early success don’t mean that artificial intelligence is going to be taking the place of pathologists, radiologists, and other diagnosticians in the near future.</p>
<p>While it is easy to get caught up in predictions of autonomous AI clinicians, Michalski suggests a bit of <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/navigating-the-hype-of-healthcare-artificial-intelligence-companies">healthy skepticism</a> about the notion that highly-trained individuals will be supplanted by machines any time soon.</p>
<p>“We’re hearing a lot in the popular press about the power of this technology, and there are articles coming out from some very smart people that say artificial intelligence will replace certain job functions or categories, which can be a little bit intimidating or even a little frightening,” he acknowledged.</p>
<p>“That comes from not yet fully understanding the boundaries of this technology and what it is really capable of doing.”</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence may be starting to get very good at classification, but human intelligence is still required to supervise AI efforts and cast a critical eye over its results.</p>
<p>“AI is very accomplished at some things, but it’s still not very good at performing other tasks,” Michalski noted.  “At the Center for Clinical Data Science, part of our mission is to define those boundaries and understand how these tools fail so we can improve them.  If AI was perfect, we wouldn’t have so much work to do every day.”</p>
<p>Instead of replacing clinicians entirely, both Michalski and Coburn believe AI will take an important supporting role.</p>
<p>“There’s a great quote that’s along the lines of ‘not all radiologists will be replaced by AI, but the radiologists who are not expert in AI will be replaced by the ones who are,’” said Coburn.</p>
<p>“AI is going to help clinicians of all types improve the things they’re doing right now.  And it will also enable some things that have never been done before. Clinicians are curious about what that is going to look like and how AI can help them become more effective and efficient.”</p>
<p>Using artificial intelligence to improve operational efficiencies and <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/can-artificial-intelligence-relieve-electronic-health-record-burnout">the EHR workflow</a> are very attractive use cases, he added.</p>
<p>“A lot of folks feel like the rise of electronic health records is coming between physicians and their patients,” he said.  “AI has the potential to reinforce the human aspect of healthcare and pull back a lot of the clumsiness of the technology interfaces we have today.  There’s a lot of hopefulness around that.”</p>
<p>Top executives and developers from a number of organizations, including Epic Systems, Change Healthcare, Optum, Nuance, Microsoft, and Health Catalyst will share their views on how to create more intuitive EHRs and more intelligent decision-making opportunities in both the clinical and operational environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/agenda/">Other sessions</a> will focus on the role of AI in drug development and precision medicine, as well as the challenges of regulating technologies that leverage brand new approaches to collecting, analyzing, and sharing big data.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see luminaries who are leading their segments of the field right now as well as folks who will be the absolute stars of their disciplines in five or ten years,” said Coburn.</p>
<p>“And there are no PowerPoints,” he added.  “We have worked hard to create opportunities for shared insights in a very rich, discussion-based format.  It’s all about communicating actionable ideas through conversations, which I think is the best way to learn.”</p>
<p>To close out the event, Partners will be putting its money where its mouth is, Coburn continued, by awarding grant funding to a series of new machine learning and AI tools developed within the Partners community.</p>
<p>“We’re going to announce the ten internal technologies that we’re going to put $50,000 against,” he said.  “That’s $50,000 each.  We’ll also be sharing our faculty’s selections of the twelve AI technologies they think will be most disruptive over the next decade.”</p>
<p>The event is designed to provide a comprehensive look at how artificial intelligence is currently used – and how it will evolve over the next few years – to significantly <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare-gets-cheaper-and-quicker">disrupt the health IT status quo</a>, said Coburn.</p>
<p>Clinicians, developers, data scientists, health IT leaders, investors, and provider executives are all encouraged to attend the crash-course in machine learning and its impacts on the industry, he urged.</p>
<p>“If you only had three days in all of 2018 to devote to AI, these would be the three days you’d want to spend doing it,” said Coburn.  “You’ll come out of there having learned what technologies are going to make the biggest impact and what areas of healthcare will be most affected by them.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be excellent preparation for making the right moves in your own organization, and we could all use as much preparation as we can get when it comes to making important decisions.”</p>

<p class="fl-post-title">Anthony Rosenzweig, MD, chief of cardiology and co-director of the Corrigan Minehan Heart Center at MGH, describes a paradox at the center of heart disease. On the one hand, the last half-century has seen a dramatic drop in death rates among patients hospitalized for a heart attack. On the other hand, survivors often go on to develop chronic conditions that are expensive and ultimately deadly. Add the aging of the world’s population and the epidemic of metabolic diseases, and heart disease remains the number one killer in the United States and most of the world, with its burden expected to increase over the coming decades.</p>
</header>
<div class="fl-post-content clearfix">
<p>The changing spectrum of heart disease has produced new clinical needs, and marshaling an effective response will require cooperation among a diverse array of stakeholders. Technology, patent insights and clinical management have combined to propel diagnosis, treatment and long term care into a new threshold. To accelerate this process, Rosenzweig and Calum MacRae, MD, PhD are co-chairing the World Medical Innovation Forum on May 1–3, 2017 to be held in Boston at the Westin Copley hotel.</p>
<p>Many top leaders from throughout the industry, government and investment communities will speak including the CEOs of a large number of leading organizations including Abiomed, AHA, Amgen, Bard, Boehringer Ingelheim, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Edwards, GE Healthcare, LivaNova, Lilly, Medtronic, Mirna, Myokardia, Philips, Siemens, Yumanity, Zafgen and Zoll Medical. They will be joined by top investors, the heads of the FDA, NHLBI and key executives from CMS and other entities.</p>
<p>This year’s agenda captures the excitement of the newly emerging chapter of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic care. It will highlight the newest approaches to treating heart failure and atherosclerosis, personal monitoring tools, breakthrough devices, metabolic syndrome, changes in pricing and policy, flexible trial design and much more. Cardiology is at the leading edge of the ongoing revolution across biomedicine and the Forum will seek to understand how this will affect every part of the translational cycle.</p>
<p>The Forum will open with twenty rising BWH and MGH stars, Harvard Medical School faculty, describing the clinical potential of their work in cardiovascular and cardiometabolic care. Discovery Café workshops will follow, led by senior Harvard faculty addressing cutting-edge cardiovascular challenges. On the final day, a panel of clinical experts from BWH and MGH will announce their selections for the “Disruptive Dozen,” the technologies likely that will have the greatest impact on cardiovascular and cardiometabolic care in the next decade.</p>
<p>MacRae describes the goal of this year’s forum as “to bring all our expertise together around the problems that our current and potential industrial partners recognize as the barriers in the future, and really think through together with these partners how we can best overcome the challenges.”</p>
<p>“Too often,” says Rosenzweig, “we are in our isolated environments and not really reaching out and interacting with our counterparts on the other side.” But, he adds, “there is no more exciting time to be in cardiovascular medicine than now. The tools we have for attacking these problems are so much more robust than they have ever been before, and the ability to merge science and clinical medicine is unparalleled. We have a large unmet need, and the hope is that industry-academic partnerships will grow out of this to move that forward.”</p>

<p class="fl-post-title">Musing over the proposal that netted him a $75 million “One Brave Idea” prize from the American Heart Association, Calum MacRae, MD, PhD, recognizing the many applicants for the grant, credits good luck and strong collaborations over ingenuity. “I think the funders were brave to give us the money.”</p>
</header>
<div class="fl-post-content clearfix">
<p>Nevertheless, MacRae, chief of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, possesses a breadth of expertise and a big-picture outlook that seem ideally suited to the purpose of the award—to support a groundbreaking idea aimed at preventing or reversing coronary heart disease. The prize is jointly funded by the American Heart Association, Google’s Verily, and AstraZenica.</p>
<p>MacRae’s aim is to develop a more complete understanding of the phenotype of cardiac disease through a combination of technological innovation and a holistic approach that views nearly every aspect of an individual’s biology as potentially relevant to the disease process. To MacRae, who runs both clinical and basic research programs studying the genetics of heart disease, “at the end of the day, genetics is the easy part; there is a single way of understanding the genomes of bacteria, conifers, humans, and everything in between.”</p>
<p>The phenotype—the various forms in which a condition expresses itself during a person’s life, starting long before there is any outward sign of illness—has received too little attention. With new dynamic phenotypes, it will be possible to improve the utility of patients’ genotypes and, in many cases, to identify the biological pathways involved in disease. With better measurement of phenotypes and the environment, and new understanding of how these enormously complex interactions lead to disease, according to MacRae, will address the rate-limiting step in modern medicine.</p>
<p>If MacRae’s proposal challenges the current cardiovascular research paradigm, that’s because the creators of the One Brave Idea prize chose to break with traditional methods of funding. Attendees were informed of the prize and given a scant four weeks to respond. Fortunately, the first-round application consisted of only four questions, each of which had to be answered in 250 words or less.</p>
<p>MacRae’s winning idea—his one brave idea, if you will—was that for the first time it might be possible to describe the phenotype of cardiac disease in a way that is precise enough, and early enough, to allow for interventions that stop it before it causes serious damage. But to do so required looking at individuals much earlier in life, and in far greater depth, than had been done previously.</p>
<p>MacRae seeks a holistic understanding of cardiac disease. In addition to studying patients’ genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes, the team will collect information on a broad range of characteristics, including features of skin, bone, behavior, and more. Though most may turn out not to be relevant to heart disease, chances are that some will, and the only way to find them is to look.</p>
<p>To illustrate where such an approach might lead, MacRae offers the example of obesity. Maybe the reason for obesity is the genetic variants that cause the disease also change the way you think about food. Or maybe they change the bacteria in your gut. We’re trying to be agnostic in the way we think about coronary heart disease. We need to think about it as a heart disease or a cholesterol disease but as a problem that we need to solve. Unless you understand the whole patient and the whole disease, it’s very difficult to understand how any individual piece of it might work.”</p>
<p>This approach would not be possible without a grant on the scale of the One Brave Idea prize. MacRae compares it to funding a startup company with its “fail-quickly” approach that supports risk-taking – “do fifty experiments, then pick the two that really work and take them across the finish line. I’m under no illusions as to how easy it will be.”<br />
After decades of medicine dominated by specialists, MacRae sees a resurgence in the role of the generalist – “but a different type of generalist, one interested in learning the fundamental rules of how everything fits together, which is made possible by new technologies and new methods of analysis.</p>
<p>The end result won’t simply be a better understanding of heart disease or even better treatment and prevention. For one thing, MacRae sees this project as overturning the way science is done. For another, it has the potential to change the doctor-patient relationship. Patient visits are shorter than they used to be, and most of the time is spent collecting data. Technology should improve collection and analysis before, during and after the appointment, freeing up time for the doctor to get to know patients on a deeper level.</p>

<h2>Highlights of the Day</h2>
<p>Day Three of the World Medical Innovation Forum was short, but was filled with some of the most exciting aspects of the meeting. The first session touched on the needs of cancer patients who require alternative strategies to achieve optimal therapeutic benefit, and the advantages and challenges associated with combination therapy.</p>
<p>The opening session was followed by a fireside chat with Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis, who provided insight into Novartis&#8217; successes and discussed current topics including CRISPR, CAR-T, a second generation of immuno-oncology, and the biggest threats to the future of innovation.</p>
<p>The morning continued with a session in which panelists discussed new cancer diagnostics driven by advances in genetics, genomics and proteomics, and the integration of these technologies into the delivery of care. This panel was followed by a discussion around the evolving role of disease-focused philanthropic foundations in patient care. For more in-depth highlights from Day Three, see below.</p>
<p>The capstone event of the Forum was the announcement of the <a href="http://cl.s6.exct.net/?qs=fc8c9e0c70cd2e56edd5b51f67c06c849eec650f884e68e52cb45eb35ed3fe5b">Disruptive Dozen</a>, the 12 technologies predicted to have the greatest impact on cancer care in the next decade. The main stage was filled with 12 influential leaders in cancer research and clinical care from Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who came together for an exciting and insightful discussion around these state-of-the-art medical technologies and what they mean for the future of the field.</p>
<p>The Forum closed with notes from Anne Klibanski, MD, Chief Academic Officer of Partners HealthCare, who noted that one of the greatest accomplishments of the Forum was the facilitation of a new community; a community that can shift paradigms and accelerate cures by having open dialogue, understanding priorities, and incorporating patient needs, expectations, and quality of life issues, and posed a challenge to the audience to maintain this dialogue even after conclusion of the meeting.</p>
<p>Next year, the Forum will focus on cardiovascular disease and will be held from May 1-3, 2017 at the Westin Copley in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.s6.exacttarget.com/lib/fe8f127274650d797c/m/1/Partners-FORUM-2016-EMAIL-TEMPLATE-160427_1732-150-2.jpg" alt="2016 World Forum" /></p>
<h2>New Philanthropy: Patients Driving Innovation</h2>
<p>As part of continued discussion around patient-driven innovation, the New Philanthropy session provided insight into the efforts of philanthropic leaders and how their community is redefining its role to develop new ways to help patients and drive breakthroughs. As disease foundations become more involved in all aspects of patient care, including the lab, clinic, engagement, and regulatory approval process, their role has evolved.</p>
<p>As gaps in funding for basic and translational research grow, these organizations have provided extensive financial support to the cancer research community, which has led to the development of breakthrough therapies and promising technologies. As Louis DeGennaro, PhD, President and CEO of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, pointed out their foundation funded the basic research that eventually led to the development of Gleevec and supported early efforts in the development of CAR-T technology at the University of Pennsylvania. Additionally, Judy Salerno, MD, President and CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, emphasized the importance of funding young investigators and remarked that, as funding has dried up, we are starving a pipeline of next-generation investigators who are needed to advance progress.</p>
<p>To provide this support, fundraising is essential, and the panel discussed the role of athletic events and social media in driving their efforts. As Dr. DeGennaro observed, cancer patients &#8220;want to win,&#8221; and athletic events such as walks, challenges, and races are a practical manifestation of that desire and are successful because &#8220;people give to people.&#8221; Supporting that notion, Billy Starr, Founder and Executive Director of the Pan-Mass Challenge, added that today&#8217;s technology allows people to reach out to their world and create bonds and opportunities that are distinct from the impact of direct mail or celebrity spokespeople. When asked about the influence of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and whether they would consider that type of engagement for their audiences, Judy Salerno, MD, President and CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, noted that their focus tends to be more directed toward the recruitment and development of people who are passionate about their mission and can become advocates.</p>
<p>To push for faster cures, panelists noted that their organizations are facilitating ongoing dialogue between patients and the FDA to address issues, concerns, and preferences, and training advocates in science to better disseminate their message. Additionally, as money raised from the Pan-Mass Challenge is donated exclusively to treatment and research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Mr. Starr also noted the patient role in the design of the Yawkey Center for Cancer Care, which was intended to advance clinical care and enhance the patient experience.</p>
<h2>Disruptive Dozen</h2>
<p>After rigorous consideration by cancer faculty from the Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the 12 technologies that are predicted to have the greatest impact on cancer care in the next decade were announced. After a short audio clip describing their disruptive technology, panelists representing each of the 12 areas enlightened the audience as to why their respective fields would have an impact on the future of cancer care in a series of sound bites.</p>
<p>Following a major theme of the Forum, and perhaps unsurprisingly, cellular immunotherapy was announced as the most disruptive technology for the next decade. Marcela Maus, MD, PhD, Director of Cellular Immunotherapy at MGH, highlighted the promise of this technology by stating that it has the potential to become a frontline cancer therapy and noting the unprecedented results seen in some patient populations thus far. However, she also noted that there are obstacles to overcome in the development of this technology for the treatment of solid tumors, which can be addressed by identifying new targets, using different engineering strategies to distinguish tumor from self, and targeting the tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>The second runner-up for most disruptive technology was liquid biopsy for oncology, and Shyamala Maheswaran, PhD, Associate in Molecular Biology, Surgery at MGH, praised the benefits of more frequent, less invasive sampling methods as compared to tumor biopsy and described the applications of this technology in early detection of cancer, monitoring of therapy, evaluation of mutational status to direct therapeutics, and assessment of heterogeneity between tumor cells for a deeper understanding of tumor evolution.</p>
<p>Coming in at number seven, genome editing was represented by Keith Joung, MD, PhD, Associate Chief of Pathology for Research at MGH. When posed the question, &#8220;how crisp are CRISPRs?&#8221; by Forum Co-Chair Daniel Haber, MD, PhD, Director of the MGH Cancer Center, Dr. Joung explained that, while limiting off-target effects at this time is a challenge, we have a distinct opportunity to develop treatments for diseases in which there are no therapies currently available and should proceed with the understanding that the technology will evolve and improve over time.</p>
<h2>Fireside Chat: Joseph Jimenez, CEO, Novartis</h2>
<p>Rounding out the fireside chat series, Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis, sat down with Gregg Meyer, MD, Chief Clinical Officer at Partners Healthcare System to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes that need to take place in the &#8220;healthcare system as a whole to a platform where all patients have access to therapies&#8221;</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s &#8220;IO strategy is to be strong with second generation approaches that target the tumor microenvironment&#8221; and the &#8220;shift away from a transactional approach to outcomes-based approach&#8221;</li>
<li>The four pillars: clinical value, patient value, health system value and societal value</li>
<li>The importance of intellectual property for driving innovation &#8211; &#8220;there are no generics without innovation&#8221;</li>
<li>The relatively low cost and continuing benefits, often extending over decades, of a drug once it comes off patent should be included in discussions of drug pricing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Highlights of the Day</h2>
<p>Day Two of the World Medical Innovation Forum was brimming with fireside chats and panel discussions. The first session of the day highlighted the growing global cancer burden in which panelists from leading international companies and key government entities discussed the challenges to providing innovative technologies in diverse markets, as well as potential strategies to overcome these obstacles.</p>
<p>In the second panel, experts provided an in-depth discussion on the promise of epigenetics for cancer research, describing the complex science behind the regulation of how genetic information is processed and the development of therapies that leverage these alterations to target cancer.</p>
<p>Two panels focused on the promise of immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer, highlighting the recent burst in the field of immuno-oncology. A set of fireside chats provided insights into drug pricing, data sharing, collaboration, and patient-driven innovation.</p>
<p>The final plenary session, moderated by CNBC Biotech and Pharma Reporter Meg Tirrell, saw a panel of oncology investors discuss some of the most compelling topics in the industry today, including the most promising technologies, investment trends, comparison to other periods in cancer investing and, naturally, drug pricing.</p>
<p>The day concluded with four concurrent focus sessions, which provided discussion around radiation therapy, oncology devices, study design for personalized cancer medicine, and the unique challenges posed by increased cancer survivorship. For more in-depth highlights from some of the most interesting panels from Day Two, see below.</p>
<p>Notably, panelists demonstrated surprising candor when discussing their personal struggles with cancer, and seemed optimistic about the current trajectory of science, with the word &#8220;cure&#8221; being used more freely in the context of cancer and without reservations of this being a crazy notion, emphasizing the reality of working towards cures.</p>

<h2>Global Cancer Markets</h2>
<p>As the global cancer burden is expected to increase from 14 million to 22 million cases by 2030, panelists from leading international companies and a key governmental entity, namely the famed National Institute for Health and Care Excellence at the UK NHS, discussed the future of cancer in a global market. Moderator Sheila Dharmarajan, Head of Business Development at Zelnick Media Capital, started out by emphasizing the term &#8220;tremendous&#8221; to describe not only the prolificacy of cancer, but also to describe the complexity of the market, breakthrough technology, and the dollars at stake in terms of both pricing and cost of innovation.</p>
<p>When posed with the question of whether pharmaceutical companies should fund diagnostics, panelists acknowledged that, due to the innate differences in business models, each company must decide their own path, but Bruno Strigini, President of Novartis Oncology, also noted the importance of considering the development of targeted therapies with companion diagnostics, which can be critical to providing the right products to the right patients.</p>
<p>Additionally, Newton Crenshaw, Vice President of North America Oncology at Eli Lilly and Company, stressed the importance of symbiosis between diagnostic and therapeutic companies, and indicated that reform is needed for regulatory bodies to accelerate diagnostics and provide access to patients. Following up on this point, Gillian Leng, MD, Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Health and Social Care at NICE, stated that this relationship could be most effective if regulatory bodies were allowed to evaluate the drug and diagnostic together.</p>
<p>As technology advances and we begin to consider cancer to be a chronic rather than terminal condition, Mr. Crenshaw also posed the question of how to best support patients beyond medicine, but noted that the cost burden of long-term treatment must be considered, as well.</p>
<h2>Immunotherapy: Checkpoint Activation, Cancer Vaccines, and Cell Based Therapies</h2>
<p>Day Two featured two panels on the promise of immunotherapy in cancer treatment in which panelists discussed various approaches to leveraging the human immune system to fight cancer, including checkpoint inhibition, anticancer vaccines, and CARTs.</p>
<p>In the first session, panelists were cautiously optimistic about immunotherapy as a tool for cancer treatment and agreed that this wave of enthusiasm is still in its early stages and we must proceed by paying particular attention to the determinants of tumor response and resistance. In this context, a recurring message was the importance of tissue biopsy and biomarker analysis before and during treatment, which will be critical to the understanding of what is happening to patients at a molecular level and, as Scott Rodig, MD, PhD, Associate Professor at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, mentioned, will be extremely important in the determination of rational drug combinations going forward.</p>
<p>Similarly, panelists also stressed that we should think carefully about how we are approaching combination therapy; rather than using a shotgun approach in which we try every drug combination, we should be deliberate in understanding the underlying mechanisms to predict optimal patient populations and avoid toxicity. More specifically, Thomas Daniel, MD, Chairman of Celgene Research, stated that we should be considering the patients for which combinations are medically valuable, along with a scientific grounding for why a specific combination makes sense, which is a more tractable and financially feasible option as compared to the shotgun approach.</p>
<p>David Reese, MD, Senior Vice President of Translational Sciences at Amgen, noted that a major challenge in the field at present is a need for the development of new surrogates for traditional response criteria; as patients live longer and overall survival becomes increasingly difficult to measure, some trial designs will essentially become intractable.</p>
<p>The second immunotherapy panel discussed what&#8217;s next for CAR T-cell therapy, with Usman (Oz) Azam, MD, Global Head of Cell and Gene Therapies Unit at Novartis, referring to the current technology to as &#8220;version 1.0.&#8221; Panelists discussed the promise of CART in hematological malignancies, but as Mark Frohlich, MD, Executive Vice President of Portfolio Strategy at Juno Therapeutics, pointed out, we must still determine the right targets for solid tumors.</p>
<p>When quizzed about the future of the technology, Dr. Azam also mentioned that gene therapy could be utilized to take CARTs to the next level, which Chuck Wilson, PhD, CEO of Unum Therapeutics, expanded upon by suggesting that the use of gene editing to target specific genes, create allogeneic T cells, or inhibit signaling pathways, could support the work of CARTs.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson also reminded the audience that the reality is, as an autologous cell therapy, the logistics of taking cells from the patient, manufacturing cells, and returning them to the patient, will be inherently more costly than other therapies, but that scalability could bring this cost down. Additionally, as Marcela Maus, MD, PhD, Director of Cellular Immunotherapy at MGH, pointed out, the development of point-of-care methods or &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; T cells that could treat many patients with one lot are potentially less costly.</p>

<h2>Fireside Chat Roundup</h2>
<p>The first two days of the Forum were filled with fireside chats, which allowed for an intimate perspective on pricing, the importance of data sharing, academic and industry collaborations, current healthcare challenges, and much more.</p>
<p>Kicking off the first fireside chat of the Forum on Monday evening, Richard Gonzalez, CEO of AbbVie, sat down with Nancy Snyderman, MD, Medical Advisor, GE Healthymagination, to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The acquisition of Pharmacyclics and the &#8220;blind dating process&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Doubling down on R&amp;D&#8221; to bring a consistent stream of good medicines</li>
<li>Catering to patients by &#8220;bringing improvements for standard of care&#8221; that the healthcare system would reward</li>
<li>The most important model today of &#8220;partnering with academic and biotech&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s lineup of fireside chats started with Amgen&#8217;s CEO Robert Bradway and Bloomberg&#8217;s biotech reporter Caroline Chen on a variety of topics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need &#8220;to collaborate outside of your organization, especially with cancer&#8221;</li>
<li>The costly price tag that comes with innovation but &#8220;the need to focus on the benefit that it brings for society&#8221;</li>
<li>Project Data Sphere, an independent and not-for-profit initiative of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer&#8217;s Life Science Consortium (learn more here).</li>
<li>A call to society to invest more in cancer prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>With nine months left on the job, Andy Slavitt, Acting Administrator for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), spoke candidly with CNBC&#8217;s biotech and pharma reporter, Meg Tirrell on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for new payment models because governments don&#8217;t have &#8220;magic pots of money&#8221; and &#8220;we are still in the 1st and 2nd generation of pricing models&#8221;</li>
<li>Finding new ways to care for the &#8220;most difficult people with the lowest income and are disconnected from the healthcare system&#8221;</li>
<li>Pilot programs for cost containment and spurring innovation focused on &#8220;doubling down on primary care and prevention&#8221;</li>
<li>The qualifications for the next CMS administrator &#8211; &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need the job, doesn&#8217;t see it as a stepping stone, doesn&#8217;t need to make friends, and has struggled to find and provide care&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Praising the industry for its strides in finding important cures for cancer, Bristol-Myers Squibb CEO, Giovanni Caforio, MD, started off his chat with Meg Tirrell by highlighting three critical points to being a leading company in oncology: keeping the patient at the center, following the science and collaborations with industry and academia. Other topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for &#8220;different payment models and flexibility in the healthcare system&#8221;</li>
<li>The &#8220;beginning stages of understanding why patients don&#8217;t respond to immunotherapies&#8221;</li>
<li>The need to focus on biomarkers as &#8220;they are really important&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding out today&#8217;s fireside chats, &#8220;patient scientist&#8221; Kathy Giusti, Founder of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium, spoke with Nancy Snyderman, MD, to discuss her journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a patient advocate, patient and business disruptor who has elevated attention and propelled advancements for multiple myeloma</li>
<li>The need for data sharing for research and cures</li>
<li>The &#8220;tough lifting&#8221; that comes with trying to stay on top of the cancer landscape</li>
<li>Partnership with Harvard Business School to &#8220;put together a business plan by which business and science could start disrupting&#8221; and &#8220;to bring the absolute best-in-class to ask the tough questions and to share and solve the problem&#8221;</li>
<li>How she made the decision to stop her own treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>Day One of the World Medical Innovation Forum began with a wave of young investigators highlighting promising developments in cancer research in a series of rapid-fire presentations. Recurring themes of the First Look session included the use of RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) as a diagnostic tool, liquid biopsies for exosome analysis, and precision medicine approaches to patient care. Multiple presentations also highlighted the capabilities of the AMIGO suite at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, which uses intraoperative imaging to guide precise localization and analysis of patient tumors during surgery.</p>
<p>Attendees then had the chance to liaise with established Harvard Medical School faculty over lunch during the Discovery Café session, which paired interested Forum-goers with renowned leaders in their respective fields. Nearly 30 faculty members covered topics such as immunotherapy, diagnostics, therapy resistance, and the potential of CRISPR for research and therapeutics.</p>
<p>The Forum plenary opened with David Torchiana, MD, CEO and Anne Klibanski MD, Chief Academic Officer of Partners HealthCare, who welcomed an audience representing more than two dozen countries and introduced a program filled with high-caliber speakers and hot topics including immunotherapy, epigenetics, and bioinformatics. They emphasized the importance of collaboration to accomplish the goal of providing better care and support to cancer patients and their families and noted that the &#8220;engine of innovation is running better than ever&#8221; as we seek to push the boundaries of the many diseases collectively known as cancer.</p>
<p>After a series of thought-provoking sessions, Astellas Pharma announced the launch of the inaugural C3 Prize<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. The day culminated with inspiring remarks from Greg Simon, Executive Director, The White House Moonshot Initiative and a fireside chat with Richard Gonzalez, CEO of AbbVie (stay tuned for more about the Forum&#8217;s fireside chats in tomorrow&#8217;s Day Two recap). For more in-depth highlights from some of the most interesting panels from Day One, see below.</p>
<h2>A War or Moonshot: Where Do We Stand?</h2>
<p>In the first panel of the day, Nancy Snyderman, MD, Medical Advisor at GE Healthymagination, sat down with Monica Bertagnolli, MD, Chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, and Daniel Haber, MD, PhD, Director of the MGH Cancer Center to discuss what&#8217;s to come in a new era of cancer research and care. The panelists were tasked with advising on whether cancer research and care over the next decade will be a war or a moonshot. Panelists agreed on both perspectives &#8211; a war because, from a patient perspective, it is a personal battle against disease and we must come together as an army to combat the disease and work effectively towards a cure, and a moonshot because progress in cancer happens with huge steps forward and reflects the combined efforts of a large group of people working toward a common goal, much like landing on the moon.</p>
<p>When asked about the funding landscape and future of academic research and development in oncology, Dr. Bertagnolli noted that, when money is tight, teamwork must be utilized, and support from patient organizations such as Stand Up To Cancer is profound. Dr. Haber also noted that we are at a magic time during which so much science is being translated, but that funds are also needed for basic research, with the rationale that, if all money goes to translational research and we do not value basic discovery, then there will be nothing to translate in the coming years.</p>

<h2>Creating a Disruptive Cancer Pipeline and Winning Portfolio Strategy</h2>
<p>A focus of Day One included cancer pipeline and portfolio development, which began with a panel discussion of how to build and maintain a successful pipeline in a challenging environment. Panelists including Keith Flaherty, MD, Director of Clinical Research at the MGH Cancer Center, and Sean Harper, MD, Executive Vice President of Research and Development at Amgen, commenting on company culture and regulatory oversight of clinical trials.</p>
<p>Jay Bradner, MD, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, noted that we may not be able to visualize what a cure for cancer will look like at this time, as technologies are still emerging, but that we should beware of paradigms, as they can sometimes make you blind to the next breaking wave.</p>
<p>In a discussion of clinical trial participation, panelists stressed the need for improved navigation of study information for patients, which would in turn facilitate the interactions between these patients and their physicians and potentially improve recruitment. It was also noted that these patients should have access to expert opinion on the best trials for their disease; as George Demetri, MD, Director of the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute noted, it should not be so much easier to find the best Chinese restaurants on &#8220;Dr. Google&#8221; than it is to find the best clinical trial.</p>
<p>Panelists discussed the need for improved infrastructure that would hasten the timeline from ideas to clinical trials and noted that the FDA is responsive to novel approaches and is looking to industry and academia for advice. Dr. Demetri also noted that such an idea is on the table, with the proposed creation of an Oncology Center of Excellence at the FDA.</p>
<p>Overall, panelists indicated that the pharmaceutical industry is receptive to insight from academia, and that the field appears to be aligned in the early drug discovery mission. In a discussion of the interactions between small companies and big pharma, panelists noted that the small companies tend to be very innovative, but investments are risky. Sean Harper, MD, noted that pharma tends to be very open to bringing assets in to their pipeline, but would rather engage early on to ensure that it&#8217;s a good product, and that takes engineering.</p>

<h2>Curative Therapies: The Economics of Game-Changing Science</h2>
<p>As novel, potentially curative cancer therapies come to market, drug pricing has emerged as one of the hottest topics of discussion. Speakers shared their insights on the balance between affordability and continued innovation in the healthcare industry, which was emphasized by Betsy Nabel, MD, with the notion that we need to provide the &#8220;right treatment for the right patients at the right time&#8221; while making it affordable.</p>
<p>Speakers included Troy Brennan, MD, Executive Vice President and CMO of CVS Health, Paul Hudson, President of AstraZeneca US, Betsy Nabel, MD, President of Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, Gary Reedy, CEO of the American Cancer Society, and Peter Slavin, MD, President of Massachusetts General Hospital. The panel was moderated by Sue Siegel, CEO of GE Healthymagination.</p>
<p>In the session, panelists discussed how to measure the effectiveness of a treatment. Dr. Slavin noted that we are facing much more economic pressure in healthcare and that it is critical to eliminate care that doesn&#8217;t help our patients. Panelists suggested that the private sector, including commercial payers, academic medical centers, pharmaceutical industry, biotech, venture, and pharmacy should come together to determine the value framework, rather than leaving it to CMS.</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson noted an inherent risk associated with developing medicines, and that the demand for breakthroughs and targeting of smaller patient populations has never been higher, while Dr. Nabel reminded us that companies must also consider the costs associated with innovation, as well as the hidden cost for future development if innovation is left behind. Panelists suggested that pharmaceutical companies, insurance providers, and pharmacy benefit management companies should come together to share risk, as all parties would be incentivized if the risk is broadly distributed.</p>
<p>When asked about when cancer will become a chronic disease, a majority of the panel agreed that it would be within 10 years, while one panelist noted that, in some patient populations, the time is now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if choosing the very best treatment for any given cancer were as routine as choosing the right kind of antibiotic to treat a common infection?</p>
<p><a href="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/KG_Headshot.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2296"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2296" src="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/KG_Headshot.jpg" alt="Kathy Giusti" width="225" height="304" /></a>Kathy Giusti, founder of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), and a cancer patient herself, has made it her personal mission. She foresees the day when an individual’s medical care will be tailored in part based on each person’s genetic make-up and other unique characteristics of his or her disease.</p>
<p>“The days of a one-size fits all approach to cancer treatment are over. We can do better than that,” Giusti said.</p>
<p>The kind of precision oncology for which Giusti advocates has already proven lifesaving for some. Patients with many forms of cancer, for instance, undergo molecular testing as a standard part of their care, enabling physicians to select treatments based on this information.</p>
<p>“Armed with focused genetic and molecular information about their patient’s distinct disease, physicians can develop personalized treatment strategies designed for maximum effectiveness,” she said.</p>
<p>But making this routine, Giusti says, requires innovative research models that prize and data-sharing and collaboration to make unprecedented advancements, an approach for which the MMRF has become widely recognized. The MMRF, by working closely with partners in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, academia, and the cancer community, injects speed and efficiency into the process of discovering and developing new drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma.  Through this collective approach, myeloma patients now have 10 new treatments – 4 treatments FDA approved in 2015 alone &#8211; that have almost tripled their survival and given thousands of others living with this incurable disease a fighting chance.</p>
<p>Now, Giusti believes this same collaborative approach can be used to usher in a new era of precision medicine and its promise of a cure: the MMRF has pioneered an end-to-end solution specifically focused on precision medicine in oncology.</p>
<p>“We generate the data, we share and aggregate the data, we analyze the data, and draw insights from these data to develop optimal treatment strategies for patients,” she said.</p>
<p>At the core of the model is a robust data ecosystem, including the first multicenter multiple myeloma tissue bank. This endeavor allowed the MMRF, along with its best-in-class partners, to sequence the myeloma genome.  The MMRF also launched the expansive, comprehensive MMRF CoMMpass<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (Relating Clinical Outcomes in Multiple Myeloma to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile) study, which has performed whole genome sequencing on over 1,000 patients and generated the largest longitudinal genomic dataset in myeloma in the public domain. The MMRF then collaborated with partners like the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, to uncover deeper insights into the disease’s biology, such as BRAF, a target previously never linked to myeloma but for which treatments have already been approved for melanoma or are now in clinical trials.</p>
<p>“Studying a large number of people – deeply and over time – allowed us to ask and answer new questions that were never before possible,” Giusti explained.</p>
<p>Today, through CoMMpass study, the MMRF is tracking the progress of these same 1,000+ patients for at least 8 years, analyzing their genetic and clinical data to better understand how certain factors influence response to treatment and disease progression and to generate hypotheses for genomically informed clinical trials. Most importantly, these data are then openly and freely shared through a global learning network, so that brilliant minds from all corners of the scientific community—including experts at the big data analytics company GNS Healthcare—can collaboratively decipher patterns for further exploration. This network was built to democratize data, allowing researchers and clinicians worldwide to share and contribute to a growing knowledge base that can be used to generate hypotheses for clinical trials and rapidly explore new and potentially more effective ways of treating myeloma.</p>
<p>Any findings can be immediately advanced into the MMRF’s worldwide network of research institutions and cancer centers that are working collectively to test an arsenal of new drugs and combination therapies. More than 30 new therapies have been in clinical trials in the network, including genomically-informed treatments – that is, those that target specific alterations in an individual that give rise to cancer or promote its spread – and immunotherapies, like checkpoint inhibitors and immunostimulatory antibodies, which are drugs that make use of a patient’s own immune system to fight cancer.</p>
<p>The MMRF’s model also includes a community of patients, who Giusti says are “every bit a part of curing the disease as scientists”.</p>
<p>These patients are stepping up to share knowledge they have gained on their cancer journeys with fellow patients—including sequencing data, when available—so they can learn which type of myeloma they have and share their data to advance research.</p>
<p>“We consider these patients as partners in our search for better, more targeted treatments,” said Giusti.</p>
<p>“As these patients, eventually, have their genomes sequenced and learn which, if any, mutations they have, can connect with other patients, engage with researchers who specialize in that particular area of genomics, and sign up for clinical trials that might be appropriate for them,” said Giusti.</p>
<p>Giusti will share more details of the MMRF’s innovative end-to-end solution for precision medicine as she sits down on April 26<sup>th</sup> for a fireside chat with Dr. Nancy Snyderman to discuss “Patients Driving Innovation” at the 2016 World Medical Innovation Forum, hosted by Partners Healthcare in Boston.</p>
<p>The World Medical Innovation Forum is a global gathering of more than 1,100 senior health care leaders hosted by Partners HealthCare in the heart of Boston. It was established to respond to the intensifying transformation of health care and its impact on innovation. The Forum is rooted in the belief that no matter the magnitude of that change, the center of health care needs to be a shared, fundamental commitment to collaborative innovation – industry and academia working together and its ability to improve patient lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BOSTON&#8211;(<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)&#8211;Partners HealthCare today announced that the upcoming <a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedforum17.wpengine.com%2F&amp;esheet=51318971&amp;newsitemid=20160413005469&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=World+Medical+Innovation+Forum%E2%84%A2&amp;index=1&amp;md5=a27680c0a6877335e7f9d91c7424fec9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">World Medical Innovation Forum<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> will include a focus on patient care, ranging from discussions of the importance of cancer prevention and early detection and the innovations that are making it possible to the unique care requirements and new technology approaches to help survivors. The 2016 Forum, an annual collaboration and partnering event held in Boston on April 25-27, will focus on cancer. CEOs and senior company executives, top investors, policy experts, and Harvard scientists leading the charge in the fight against cancer will take the stage over the course of the three-day Forum for a series of sessions that will critically examine the innovations in and evolution of cancer care.</p>
<p>“Technological advances in diagnostics are beginning to make it possible to detect cancer at the earliest stages of the disease when treatment may be most effective,” said David Louis, MD, Pathologist-in-Chief, Massachusetts General Hospital and Benjamin Castleman Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School. “However, there have been many barriers to making these innovative tests widely available to patients, including the need for more research and development to ensure accuracy, better guidance to speed the regulatory process and new models to support their value and reimbursement. This Forum provides a space for us to learn about these exciting new diagnostic technologies and to collaborate on the scientific and economic challenges that preventative strategies and early cancer detection bring about.”</p>
<p>“Detecting cancer as early as possible in the developmental stage will help both patients and hospitals in terms of prognosis with possible cure or therapy regimens before the cancer has spread. It will also help avoid the economic burden typically associated with late-stage detection,” said Massimo Loda, MD, Senior Pathologist, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Principal Investigator, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School. “The technologies we are creating and pursuing are designed to detect and pursue cancer cells at the most vulnerable point in their development: the very beginning. The Forum will provide us with the opportunity to discuss those advances and learn of other new developments in a collaborative manner.”</p>
<p>The prevention of cancer and the development of new strategies to detect cancer precursors and early-stage malignancies when treatment may be most effective – clinically and financially — are critical research goals. The experts on the “<b>Early Detection and Prevention of Cancer</b>” panel will review powerful imaging modalities, single-cell analysis of the tumor microenvironment and next-generation cancer models. They will also discuss circulating tumor DNA testing to monitor response to treatment and emergence of cancer resistance—with the objective of early cancer diagnosis before symptoms appear. The panel will take place at <b>4:50 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</b></p>
<p>Panel participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Moderator: <b>David Louis</b>, MD, Pathologist-in-Chief, MGH and Benjamin Castleman Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><b>Andy Chan</b>, MD, Program Director, Gastroenterology Training Program, MGH and Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School</li>

<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><b>Krishna Kumar</b>, CEO, Emerging Businesses, Philips</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><b>Massimo Loda</b>, MD, Senior Pathologist, Principal Investigator, BWH, Dana-Farber and Professor, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School</li>
</ul>
<p>“The number of people diagnosed with cancer is continuing to grow at an astounding rate and while new treatment advances are enabling more and more of these patients to survive, there is an increasing need for innovative tools and resources to address the changing needs of patients, their families and the health care system,” said Claire Thom, Pharm D, Senior Vice President, Global Oncology Development, Astellas.</p>
<p>Extraordinary treatment advances have turned many cancers from apparent death sentences into manageable chronic illnesses with extraordinary consequences for the entire health care system. In the United States, there are approximately 14 million cancer survivors, up from just three million four decades earlier. Those survivors have unique care requirements, that will put enormous stress on the system and calling out for new technology solutions. A program, titled “<b>Surviving Cancer: New Realities, New Needs</b>,” will discuss those requirements and the technologies and approaches that can help monitor, guide, and connect patients. The panel will take place at <b>4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 26, 2016, in the Takeda Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</b></p>
<p>Panel participants include:</p>
<ul>

Dr. Cobbold is a member of the MGH Center for Cancer Immunology and his research focuses on understanding how the healthy human-immune response is able to recognize and target cancerous cells and, when it fails, how it could be strengthened to recognize this threat. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Cobbold’s presentation will focus on “Tumor Antigens in Cancer and How to Manipulate Antigens to Stimulate Immunity.” You can catch him and a wide variety of creative minds presenting their most promising commercially related research during First Look: The Next Wave of Cancer Breakthroughs, happening at the start of the Forum on Monday, April 25. </em></strong><strong><em>These rapid-fire presentations by early-career Harvard Medical School faculty will highlight compelling new discoveries and insights that will be the cancer care products of the future. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about yourself and why you have an interest in the World Forum:</strong></p>
<p>We moved my lab, the Cobbold Lab, about 9 months ago from Britain to the MGH Cancer Center and we’re currently looking into different immunotherapies for cancer. The research we’re conducting has lead me to conclude that most people have experienced some early form of cancer, but our immune response has protected us from these insults. We believe that in many cases it is when our immune response fails that we develop cancer. The solution we’ve developed is designed to strengthens the immune system to address the cancer in a very different but targeted way, instead of suppressing immunity like treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p>
<p>Let me explain this a bit further. We have ionizing radiation going through our bodies every second of every day, and our cells accumulate a small number of genetic errors (mutations) regularly. Life is a process of genetic decay, and I passionately believe that as a long-lived animal living to about 80, which is our genetic life expectancy, we probably all develop cancerous cells thousands of times throughout our lifetime. Thankfully, there are multiple processes that prevent cancer from taking hold, some intrinsic to each cell through DNA repair and damage detection, and some extrinsic. Epidemiological data clearly shows for the first 50 years of our lives the incidence of cancer is very low suggesting that our bodies keep it at bay, and an immunological mechanism may play a dominant role in this. However, once you get past the age of 50, particularly once we get past 70, the incidence of cancer increases very rapidly. This correlates very strongly with the age at which our immunity starts to fail. Until recently, drug companies have been focused on finding ways to suppress immune responses to prevent the body from attacking itself (for patients with autoimmune disease). There is a huge arsenal of drugs available that can be prescribed to suppress immunity. In contrast there are very few drugs available that strengthen our immunity.  What we desperately need are new agents to stimulate and restore immunity and the pharmaceutical industry needs to spend the next 10-20 years developing such therapies.</p>
<p>My research is born out of real curiosity. We all have family members that have died from cancer, but I can’t say that’s what driven me to science. I’m driven really through intellectual curiosity and a desire to do something useful for society. In translating discoveries from the lab into the clinic, the process of innovation is critical for patients’ benefits, and the World Medical Innovation Forum seems to be particularly aligned and targeted towards that particular audience. I do a lot of work that could translate into the clinic, sort of bridging both sides of that pond, so the premise of the Forum is very close to my heart.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a little about the Cobbold Lab and the work you’re currently doing with MGH?</strong></p>
<p>My lab at the moment is just getting off the ground, having been in the US for less than a year. One of the main projects we’re working on is how our immune system is able to identify the difference between healthy cells and cancer cells. In a sense, our immune systems are playing a continuous “Spot the Difference” picture game, where the immune system has got to look at the difference between the upper and lower picture panels, and sometimes the difference is not that easy to distinguish. To an immune cell (T-cell) a cancer cell could be a dividing healthy cell or an enemy, based on the coating around the cell. The question is how does the immune system spot the difference?</p>
<p>So part of my lab’s focus is taking a non-cancerous cell and a cancerous cell and characterizing the peptides on the surface of the cells. The immune system basically interrogates the peptide display on the cell surface and determines the difference between cells. We use a technique called Mass Spectrometry which is able to characterize peptides and spot the differences between cancerous and non-cancerous cells.</p>
<p>All cells are composed of proteins, and our DNA although critical to each cell, can be seen as just the instruction book that makes proteins. It is the proteins that function as the active parts of the cell; however, these parts can be decorated which controls their function. To use a baking analogy, the proteins can be thought of as cakes with the cell as the bakery. Using this analogy, the healthy cell bakery and the cancer cell bakery usually have the same cakes on sale.  However, the decorations on the cakes are very different. In the cancer cell bakery, the cherries (reflecting phosphate groups) haven’t been put on in the correct places, often showing extra cherries. A lot of research groups are looking for the “cake” vaccine. In my lab, we’re not interested in the actual the <em>types</em> of cakes. Instead, we are analyzing their differences by looking at what the cakes are decorated with, i.e. where the cherries lie.</p>
<p>The proteins in a cell are “decorated” with phosphate groups and sugar groups through a process called posttranslational modifications, which is like sprinkling cherries on top to maintain the baking analogy, and the number of cherries present changes multiple times during a cell’s lifetime. The difference between cancer and non-cancer cells is that the cherries, or phosphate groups, are put in different places and it turns out that these groups are retained when the proteins are chopped up and displayed on the surface of the cells. We believe this identifies a cell as either cancerous or not. Ultimately we can either look at the different cakes that exist, or we can examine how they’re decorated to determine a course of action for treatments and therapies.</p>
<p>Despite failing immunity <em>against</em> cancer, people with cancer still have strong immunity to viruses. Thus patients with cancer usually still have strong functioning immunity, it just isn’t focused on cancer. What we’re proposing is to decorate cancer cells to make them look like the viruses that people already have immunity to. In this way we are matching what is displayed on the tumors with what T-cells we have.</p>
<p>Arguably, we’ve got everything wrong right now with cancer therapies. From an immunology point of view, we are essentially strengthening the cancer by giving it new mutations through the use of radiation and chemotherapy, while suppressing the immune response at the same time. We are trying to poison the cancer and in the process end up poisoning everything else as well. Too often these treatments, unfortunately, only give patients a couple of extra months, and seldom curing the patient entirely. Currently, there is huge excitement in potentiating anti-cancer immunity and understanding how the immune system can detect and kill tumors, but also how tumors evade detection and control.</p>
<p><strong>What do you find is the most challenging aspect of your work? </strong></p>
<p>Well that’s a challenging question on its own! I’d have to say getting a hold of the right clinical material and data from patients is a challenge, and getting the right people and funding to continue pursuing one’s research is critical.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you come to the US?</strong></p>
<p>For those challenges really. Funding is a bit of a challenge everywhere. Competition is really high; I think there are too many researchers applying for the same pot of money. This keeps the quality of research high; but the price is huge sector inefficiency. I’m a bit of a paradox here, because I think it’s easier to get funding in Europe than in the U.S., and thus I’ve moved into a more challenging funding environment. But this is more than balanced by the huge opportunities here. Boston/Cambridge is one of the largest life sciences ecosystems in the world and thus a very efficient place to work, and that is a big draw on its own. There’s a lot of good stuff going on here, and from a life sciences’ perspective this place rocks.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be spending some time at the Forum after the First Look session?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll probably be staying around for a fair amount of it. I want these meetings to yield real actions that can produce real results for patients. This seems to be the ideal Forum to connect the right people together to really achieve something that hasn’t been done before. I’m excited to see what happens next!</p>

Dr. Lin’s presentation will focus on “Making the Virtual Biopsy a Reality: Advances in MR Spectroscopy of Cancer.” His research interests include clinical applications of multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the brain, breast, and liver, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. We recently had a chance to talk with Dr. Lin and hear more about the research he’s conducting, his goals moving forward, and what he finds most challenging in his work.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Please tell us about yourself and your interests in the World Forum:</strong><br />
I’ve been working in the field of magnetic spectroscopy for about 18 years now. It’s a very powerful research tool that affects many areas in neurological diseases, but it’s never really crossed over into clinical use. That’s one of my big goals, and that’s really why I came to the Brigham to try to translate this really powerful technology into the clinic.</p>
<p>Instead of getting pictures of the brain, or whatever body part that one typically does with an MRI machine, we measure the chemistry. The power of this technique is it allows us to really get a better understanding of what is going on pathophysiologically in the brain and other parts of the body. This technology is available on every MRI scanner and these chemicals that we can measure, the phrase we use is “Virtual Biopsy,” allow us to really get at what’s going within the tissue of the brain itself.</p>
<p>When we looked at ideas that could be commercialized, I really wanted to push something that I felt would be very clinically relevant and important. Take for example, a very specific marker for cancer – 2-hydroxyglutarate, a chemical that is produced only by a mutation that is found in about 70% of all brain tumors. The potential to use magnetic spectroscopy to measure this chemical is something that oncologists are really excited about. They have been ordering these [virtual biopsy] tests on patients, while also being a part of a number of clinical trials developing this technology further.</p>
<p>Connecting with potential collaborators who can help to advance the commercial application of magnetic spectroscopy is a part of my interest in the Forum. We’re already using this technology in clinics today, but one of the big barriers to widespread use and adoption has been that the software that we use to currently use analyze data has always been in the hands of people like myself, researchers. These research tools are not designed to be easy to use. It’s not designed to be friendly. It’s powerful and very accurate but difficult for clinicians to use within their workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Your recent Innovation Grant from BWH Department of Radiology and Innovation Hub focused on magnetic spectroscopy Tell us a little more about BrainSpec and what you’re hoping to accomplish:</strong><br />
I was very lucky to have a wonderful physicist working with me, Ben Rowland, who is also a brilliant programmer, and he, too, felt the ability to analyze data on this level was something that has been missing from the field. Together with Alex Zimmerman, from Harvard Business School, we put together BrainSpec, which is a web-based software platform to provide a brain cancer diagnosis within minutes without any surgical intervention and 100% specificity. This software is designed by radiologists for radiologists, and we have been working in conjunction with the Brigham Radiology Team as well as people even from MassArts and other local universities to really develop a software that would be intuitive and easy to use for people. Much in the way that Apple strives for simplicity in its products, you could almost call it the “Apple of spectroscopy” because it really tends towards being easy to use, therefore making it easier to implement in the clinic and to move this kind of technology forward.</p>
<p><strong>What do you find is the most challenging aspect of developing these kinds of technologies to facilitate early-detection?</strong><br />
For me, as a researcher, I’m not used to the business world. The requirements that are needed to take something from a prototype and turn it into a commercial product, such as FDA approval, are things I’m learning along the way. What’s been really valuable and fortunate is that we have the innovation staff at the Brigham and across Partners that have been incredibly helpful and supportive in trying to get this out there. The Brigham iHub really helped guide us through the process of what things are important and what are not in terms of developing a prototype. As a scientist you often get wrapped up in looking at the bigger picture and they really helped me stay on top of the important things, such as the user interface design. This platform will be fully automated and will allow us to get the results almost instantaneously, we’re talking maybe two or three minutes for it to spit back the information. Time and usability have been driving factors in BrainSpec’s development. As a researcher you just say, “Oh whatever, I’ll just code it” but there’s so much more to it and this has been very different and forced us to approach this platform in a very different way, which is of course new and exciting to me. It’s a newer way of looking at science than I had done before.</p>
<p>For the most part, this kind of technology has not been made available to the more general medical public, but we find it is currently thriving in academic settings. You have to find someone like myself who has experience in magnetic spectroscopy to translate the data as it stands right now. Making this more available on a clinical level is one of the goals of BrainSpec.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have plans to stay for the Forum after the First Look session?</strong><br />
Yes! I definitely want to see what else is happening and take part in this great networking opportunity. I’m entering this world of innovation so much more as of late, and there are interesting challenges I find myself facing as a faculty member in a hospital environment. It will be great to hear others discuss this issue, as well as other areas of development in oncology research.</p>

<p>BOSTON — March 23, 2016 — Partners HealthCare today announced that highlights at the upcoming World Medical Innovation ForumTM will include the global economics of cancer care. The 2016 Forum, an annual collaboration and partnering event held in Boston on April 25-27, will focus on cancer. CEOs and senior company executives, top investors, policy experts, and Harvard scientists leading the charge in the fight against cancer will take the stage over the course of the three-day Forum for a series of sessions that will critically examine the changing economic cancer-care landscape.</p>
<p>Novel, potentially curative cancer therapies are coming to market, with the promise of unprecedented patient benefits. While most key stakeholders have recognized the cost effectiveness of curative therapies, these therapies also present a challenge to payers in terms of the potential spike in patient volume and high cost as many of these innovative cancer therapies are being introduced. The “Curative Therapies: The Economics of Game Changing Science” panel will bring together top executives from the pharma, foundation, pharmacy, and provider sectors to explore cost effectiveness as part of regulatory approval. They will also examine the increasing emphasis on early detection, shifting incentives for oncologists, and how integrating billing codes, bundled payments, and management fees can help bring drug costs down. This panel will take place at 3:10 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</p>

<li>Peter Slavin, MD, President, MGH and Professor of Healthcare Policy, Harvard MedicalSchoolAccording to the American Cancer Society, cancer causes 1 in 7 deaths worldwide and is rapidly becoming a global epidemic. If rates don’t change, the World Health Organization predicts that the global cancer burden will increase from 14 million new cases and 8 million cancer-related deaths worldwide to 22 million cases and 13 million deaths by 2030.“The shift to treating cancer as a chronic disease and the multitude of new treatments and technologies available to health care providers are impacting the financial aspect of cancer treatment,” said Marc de Garidel, Chairman and CEO, Ipsen, the global specialty-driven pharmaceutical company. “The issue is treated differently from country to country and there are many lessons to be learned from the outcomes of each approach.”
<p>To kick off the program on Tuesday, expert panelists from leading international companies and key governmental entities, including the famed National Institute for Health Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom, will discuss how approaches to deliver innovative technologies differ in various international markets, what the respective drivers are, and the requirements and challenges that must be met. The program, titled “Global Cancer Markets,” will focus on key strategies and trends in the international market and will begin at 8:15 a.m. on Tuesday, April 26, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BOSTON&#8211;(<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)&#8211;Partners HealthCare today announced the second annual <a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedforum17.wpengine.com%2F&amp;esheet=51290750&amp;newsitemid=20160302005224&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=World+Medical+Innovation+Forum%E2%84%A2&amp;index=1&amp;md5=fc6287f453d6169ef1f5183a9fa6210f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">World Medical Innovation Forum<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, which will bring together more than 1,100 international cancer technology decision-makers from industry, investment, clinical and research communities, April 25-27, 2016 in Boston.</p>
<p>Forum keynoters include the CEOs of Novartis, BMS, Amgen and Abbvie who will join more than 100 total speakers &#8212; all experts in new cancer technology from industry, the investment community and Harvard Medical School. World Forum attendees include senior executives, investors, entrepreneurs, clinicians and scientists. The focus of the Forum is new cancer technologies and the cooperative innovation among industry, academia, government and philanthropy required to make them happen.</p>
<div class="bw-release-story">
<p>“Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. Developing new means of treating and diagnosing cancer requires an active collaboration between clinicians, scientists, companies and investors to identify and address patient needs,” said Daniel Haber, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Cancer Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. “The outcomes of this cooperation will ultimately affect the lives of patients worldwide.”</p>
<p>Over the three days, the 2016 Forum will highlight emerging cancer innovations in immunotherapy, epigenetics, early diagnosis, combination therapies, as well as curative drugs, cancer markets, the role of patients in innovation, cancer as a chronic disease and investment strategies.</p>
<p>The Forum is co-chaired by Daniel Haber, M.D., Ph.D., and Monica Bertagnolli, M.D., Chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School. Academic speakers include Harvard Medical School-appointed clinicians and investigators from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>“The recent advances in the targeted treatment of cancer are extremely exciting and have set the stage for us to understand cancer biology as never before,” said Monica Bertagnolli, M.D. “While the progress in treating patients has been encouraging, cancer is a large and diverse group of diseases and it is continually evolving, making the need for innovation constant if we are to achieve our goals of prevention and cure. Pushing boundaries back requires collaboration across sectors.”</p>
<p>A highlight of the Forum is a showcase of the most promising cancer technology innovations from around the world &#8212; the 12 technologies with the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and patient care over the next decade. The final selections, called “The Disruptive Dozen,” will be announced on the last day of the Forum. Another highlight will be rapid fire presentations by emerging cancer research stars. The “First Look: Next Wave of Cancer Breakthroughs” session will kick off the Forum at 8AM Monday April 25.</p>
<p>The World Medical Innovation Forum is organized by Partners HealthCare Innovation, a division of Partners HealthCare dedicated to advancing the commercial application of the unique capabilities of Partners’ academic medical centers. “The breadth of the topics that will be covered and the commitment to interdisciplinary engagement from international leaders across academia, finance, industry and public policy makes the Forum an unrivaled, must-attend event,” said Chris Coburn, Partners Vice President for Innovation and conference organizer.</p>
<p>Sponsors of the Forum include Novartis, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Takeda, Amgen, Astellas, General Electric, Ipsen, AstraZeneca, MacDougall Biomedical Communications, Ropes and Gray, Mintz Levin, McCall and Almy, and Vertex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final day of the inaugural Partners HealthCare World Medical Innovation Forum was a fittingly profound end to a thought-provoking meeting that featured leaders from business, research, and clinical practice discussing the most important and relevant topics of the day related to healthcare and brain disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reshaping Innovation Through Electronic Health</strong></em></p>
<p>The day began with a conversation on the history and current implementation of electronic health records between Partners’ Chief Clinical Officer, Gregg Meyer, MD and Judy Faulkner, the founder and CEO of leading electronic medical records company, EPIC Systems. Faulkner shared the story behind and the philosophy with which grew the company 100% organically (without mergers or acquisitions) from a 2-employee shop in a basement in Madison, Wisconsin, to a healthcare software powerhouse with approximately $2 billion in annual revenues and over 6,000 employees. She explained that EPIC Systems designed the software from the very beginning with the patients and their records as the central focus and organizing principle.</p>
<p>EPIC systems supports all functions related to patient care, including registration, scheduling; clinical systems for doctors, nurses, lab technologists, pharmacists, radiologist and billing systems for insurers. With the comprehensive implementation of EPIC at Partners currently underway, Faulkner offered some suggestions about the implementation based on the experience of EPIC’s other major clients. She suggested that providers and administrators should take advantage of EPIC’s customization options, training offerings, user groups, and especially “MyChart,” the patient engagement platform, which is unusual among its peers because it has 10 times the number of patient users as it does provider users—illustrating that the patients are very engaged. Patients see it has a form of freedom, being able to fill out their own information in some cases, providing better care through self service. The applications vary from engagement through scheduling and payment, to video doctors’ “visits.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Gene Editing, Gene Therapy, and the Eye as a Gateway</strong> </em></p>
<p>During this panel discussion, leaders from industry and research discussed the progress and promises of developing effective gene therapies. Eric Pierce, MD, PhD, of Mass. Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School, stated his sense that the community is truly “on the threshold of using all these technologies.” The panelists recalled some of the challenges and failures of the past 20 years, but highlighted some extraordinary advances, compelling drug candidates, and continued confidence in gene therapies becoming a more and more integral therapy for providers for both rare and eventually more common diseases (including HIV, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia). Another panelist noted the great success of the CRISPR gene-editing platform, stating that scientists were overheard making statements rarely heard in genomics, such as “I tried it and it worked”. CRISPR is empowering scientists to make quick and inexpensive edits to stretch of DNA with a level of ease and efficiency not previously possible.</p>
<p><em><strong>MS Transformed: Harnessing Biology and Inflammation</strong></em></p>
<p>“MS Transformed: Harnessing Biology and Inflammation” brought together an expert panel across disciplines: Tim Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services, and Research Officer at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Alfred Sandrock, MD, PhD, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Biogen, Howard Weiner, MD, Founder and Director of the Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center, and Michael Panzara, MD, Group Vice President and Therapeutic Area Head of Multiple Sclerosis and Neurology at Genzyme.</p>
<p>The panelists began the conversation by providing context into the multiple sclerosis (MS) landscape since the condition’s initial description 150 years ago. At the beginning of Weiner’s career in the 1970s, there was very little understanding of MS and no treatments or MRI scans available for diagnosis, treatment, and assessment of the disease. Today, MS is thought to be a success story within neurologic disease discovery as there are 12 FDA approved drugs on the market. The rapid rate of drug discovery and available MS therapies is largely due to a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind MS, the identification of testable targets, and measurable outcomes thanks to advances in biomarkers and MRI imaging.</p>
<p>These 12 drugs currently on the market are utilized as treatments of the relapsing-remitting type of MS and there are no known therapies specifically for secondary-progressive MS. This leaves behind a large population of MS patients in terms of therapeutic development and makes the current treatment choices far from perfect. Clinically, MS patients often go through a trial and error process to see which medications work best for them. Some patients can switch therapies for years before finding the right fit for them while brain damage continues to occur.</p>
<p>The emphasis on increased treatment options for individuals with MS leads into the question of what a cure will inevitably look like. Dr. Weiner mentions his three prong approach to a “cure”, which consists of: 1) rebuilding a damaged nervous system, possibly via stem cells and myelin repair, 2) controlling attacks through individualized therapies to stabilize the condition, and 3) eradicating MS through a preventative vaccine. Under this notion, the pioneering drug discovery process of the last two decades has led many MS patients to a “cure” as their disease remains stable without attacks.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the panel enthusiastically agreed about the possibilities precision or individualized medicine will have for patients with MS and their physicians. The ability to prescribe the right drug to the right patient at the right time in the disease course will treat MS with greater efficacy and lead to an increased quality of life beyond the current trial and error system. Individualized therapies will undoubtedly involve continuous follow-up with patients that monitoring devices and big data will likely play a role in. It is not uncommon for current patients with MS to schedule clinical visits every 6 to 12 months, and a great deal can change in their symptoms and care during that time. Sandrock, MD describes a future that will utilize technology similar to a Google Watch for patients to measure their daily symptoms and regimens and scan for lesions and brain shrinkage without full-blown MRI imaging — all while contributing to pivotal clinical trials. Lastly, the panel mentioned an emphasis on drug discovery to help prevent and treat the secondary-progressive disease course. Upcoming therapies may also rely on the microbiome or human gut for answers addressing the role of the immune system in MS.<br />
As Panzara concluded, the questions that we will ask and developments we will make in MS research and care over the next 5 years are unpredictable and will surprise us.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Century of the Molecule Becomes the Century of the System </em></strong></p>
<p>Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital surgeon, bestselling author, and healthcare thought leader Atul Gawande, MD gave a moving and thought-provoking talk on healthcare quality and healthcare costs from the 19th century until today. He discussed the great reduction in inpatient mortality at MGH from the 1950s to the 1990s. Then, Gawande noted that the relative lack of improvement from approximately 1990 coincided with a dramatic increase in the cost per patient. He used this trend to frame a conversation about increasing cost and complexity without improvements in quality. He subsequently discussed the extraordinary reductions in patient mortality in surgery that had been achieved around the world at very little cost with the introduction of a coordinated systems approach and simple checklists used before and after surgery.</p>
<p>Using personal anecdotes and experiences, he discussed his more recent work around death and dying. He explained that since the 1980s, the trend has been that most Americans are dying in institutions and often while undergoing dramatic interventions. He explained that this flies in the face of many people&#8217;s preference &#8212; when asked &#8211; -to die at home and/or without such dramatic and often painful curative or “life-saving” measures. He closed by discussing the systems, planning, and checklist efforts he was helping to develop and implement to improve the experience of death for people and their families &#8212; often simply by making sure that providers, patients, and family members simply take time to discuss the patients&#8217; preferences and priorities around death and dying.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Builder’s Roundtable: Perspectives of Public/Private Payer Architects</em></strong></p>
<p>In this session, Partners SVP Tim Ferris, MD moderated a lively and insightful discussion about healthcare costs, payers, and economics with Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini and Affordable Care Act architect Peter Orszag, PhD, who is a Citigroup senior executive and former Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Director of the United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO).</p>
<p>During this conversation, Bertolini shared his own dramatic personal and family healthcare history, as well as his perspective that healthcare in the United States was on a &#8220;burning platform&#8221; and that the Affordable Care Act created the impetus for conversations that needed to happen. Both agreed that the fee-for-service models are unsustainable and do not incentivize quality or cost control. They also agreed that the Affordable Care Act and related reforms were helping to move the country toward a new model that would be predicated on outcomes and include some mechanism to align incentives to encourage providers, consumers, and other market actors to contain escalating healthcare costs.</p>
<p>While emphasizing that extraordinary challenges remained, both shared some concrete reasons for hope. Bertolini shared that a targeted pilot program that Aetna had run to prevent hospitalizations among heart failure patients had reduced hospital visits by approximately 49%. Orszag shared his perspective that the recently announced 2.8% unadjusted Medicare cost increase was a positive sign that it is indeed possible to control healthcare costs and also that the Affordable Care Act may be having its intended effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A powerful summary of many of the innovations discussed at the Forum the past 3 days, the “Disruptive Dozen” is more than just a registry of buzz words; this list represents the optimistic current state of neuroscience and one to look back on in years to come to see the progress made.</p>
<p><strong>12. DIAGNOSING AND TREATING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES THROUGH THE MICROBIOME</strong><br />
For the first time, the gut microbiome is now being examined as a therapeutic target. The body’s largest immune system holds many clues to neurological health. For example, a high-fat diet increases the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders. Changes in the microbiome in the imbalance of certain bacteria could affect microglial cells in the brain.</p>
<p><strong>11. NEUROIMAGING FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS</strong><br />
With more advanced, high-gradient 7 tesla MRI, the possibilities for imaging are plentiful. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), comparisons are being made between the brains of symptomatic patients and non-symptomatic. Depression and anxiety – both neurocircuitry disorders – are being mapped with higher resolution and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>10. IMMUNE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS FOR BRAIN CANCER</strong><br />
Checkpoint inhibitors could potentially stop the progression of brain cancer in certain subsets of patients. In advanced metastatic melanoma, where cancer reaches the brain, inhibitors produce better responses. Induced immunity is gearing the body for a stronger attack against the tumor.</p>
<p><strong>9. HEALING THE BRAIN WITH NEUROMODULATION</strong><br />
“Electricity for healing” is proving to be a viable treatment for improving working memory, making people more alert, and positively affecting people with neurocircuitry disorders such as tremors, addiction, PTSD, etc. There are 350,000 people in the United States with these “brain pacemakers.”</p>
<p><strong>8. MOLECULAR INTERVENTION WITH MINIMALLY INVASIVE TECHNOLOGY</strong><br />
The heterogeneity of tumors is affecting our approaches of targeting them. Because not every tumor is the same and not even the cells of one act the same all of the time, delivery devices with the capability of turning on or off different tumor expressions are key.</p>
<p><strong>7. NEW ASPECTS OF GENE THERAPY</strong><br />
More than 10,000 diseases are caused by a single gene defect. The explosion in gene therapy will be in editing techniques and “resilience” genes that can make diseases milder.</p>
<p><strong>6. THE PROMISE OF BRAIN BIOMARKERS</strong><br />
Finding biomarkers is the key to advancing drug development. For example, in AD, biomarkers found in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and on images of the brain appear years before symptoms present.</p>
<p><strong>5. THE PROMISE OF FOCUSED ULTRASOUND</strong><br />
The brain hides behind the skull and the blood-brain barrier. To be able to target deep tissue without radiation or incision means less time spent in the operating room and a quicker recovery for patients than current procedures allow. Less energy would be needed for the procedure, and reversible entry into the blood-brain barrier could mean safer, repeat procedures if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>4. RAPID INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS</strong><br />
In acute settings, suicidal ideation is an emergency. Symptoms of psychiatric disorders need faster intervention to keep patients and the people around them safe. Anti-depressants can take up to weeks to have an effect and may not produce an effect in some people. Techniques such as anesthetics, inhalants, and electrotherapy could soon be more widely deployed in emergency rooms.</p>
<p><strong>3. SMART BRAIN PROSTHETICS</strong><br />
Imagine what a “closed-loop thermostat” in the brain could do for many neurological diseases. They could restore quality of life to the physically impaired by stroke. These small devices would be implanted into the brain to stave off disease as it arises with no side effects.</p>
<p><strong>2. STEM CELL THERAPY TO REPAIR AND REPLENISH THE BRAIN</strong><br />
Regenerative medicine is recreating cells that are deficient, diseased, or missing. The use of stem cells and cell-based therapies is still controversial and presents moral and ethical issues as well as regulatory hurdles. However, it is undeniable that the brain is incredibly “plastic” and boasts an elegant biofeedback system. To use cells to correct a dysfunction requires great specificity.</p>
<p><strong>1. EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE</strong><br />
Fourty-four million people worldwide suffer from clinical AD, and many more go undiagnosed. It is a global health concern at the forefront of neuroscience. Speeding up drug discovery, tau protein immunotherapy, a-beta reduction, and robust imaging are just four of many tactics being used in the journey to a cure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>National Security Through Neurodevelopment: County Initiatives to Meet CNS Challenges</strong><br />
Neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases threaten the United States and wide swaths of the globe. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), alone &#8212; where 120 million across the world may be affected by mid-century &#8212; may cost trillions of dollars. The economic burden on families and governments will be tremendous and could lead to a global economic crisis over the next generation.</p>
<p>The demographic trends are clear: In western society, we have added a third to our lifespan and have low birthrates. As a result, we face a tsunami as the populations across the globe age. Until recently, AD, was a fairly rare disease, with the risk being 1 in 8 at age 65, but rising sharply to 1 in 2 at age 85. AD will be a common occurrence more and more in the future, as it correlates well with age.</p>
<p>But governments across the world have been slow to recognize this. NIH funding for AD was approximately $600 million last year. By comparison, HIV/AIDS spending was over $3 billion. To invest now in basic research will save the estimated $1.2 trillion Americans will be spending per year to care for AD in only 20 years. David Cameron’s call for a global fight on AD during the 2013 meeting of the G8 is a start. The UK’s $100 million Dementia Discovery Fund is another effort to develop collaborations between the public, private and non-profit sectors.</p>
<p>To heighten the alarm and call to action, we ought to stop looking at this just as a disease process, but rather as an economic crisis. WHO has issued a report on the coming pandemic. But where are reports from the World Bank or IMF? We should re-think spending on health and medical research not as a cost but as an investment &#8212; just as we did on a global scale with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Due to stigma, there’s no public voice for mental illness as there is for other diseases. And for mental illness, the funding situation is even more critical. NIH spends far less on mental illness than other neurological conditions. Pharma is still investing in neuro, but it is getting out of R&amp;D and drug discovery for psychiatry. This will obviously reduce the number of therapies in clinical trials and will drastically reduce the pipeline of young scientists entering the field.</p>
<p>Perhaps a paradigm shift in our thinking will help: AD is not as a disease of 80-year olds; it is a disease in its early stages of people in their 40s and 50s. Collaboration and leadership are needed from the political, corporate and NGO sectors to capitalize on this realization. After all, our collective cognitive health will equal our economic wealth.</p>
<p><strong>Technology, Pathology, Radiology: Changing the Game through Neurodiagnostics </strong><br />
The promise in imaging lies in being able to detect disease through multiple modalities and thus, diagnose sooner and more accurately. In the past, neurological diseases were studied post-mortem, and we depended on lesions to show function and structural correlation. The shift has moved from first a gross level, then a cellular level, and now a molecular level – finding out which genes and proteins are altered to cause inflammation and tissue damage. Becoming more “micro” and using data analytics will be continuing trends. Today’s imagers and pathologists are excited about possibilities in wearable MR, and radioomics. The recent changes in WHO classification of brain tumors to add molecular properties shows the global shift of diagnostics towards a more personalized approach. Our techniques are getting smaller and data is getting bigger – a promising combination.</p>
<p><strong>Autism and Neurodevelopment: Are Therapies Possible Today?</strong><br />
This session, moderated by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author, and Director of the Project on Public Narrative at Harvard University, Ron Suskind, explained that, 20 years ago, his own son was diagnosed with autism, at a time when not much was known of this “Rainman” affliction. The diagnosis of autism has exponentially increased and is now largely a public health issue.</p>
<p>The panel focused on the hurdles the speakers collectively face studying autism. The majority, about 25% of severe autism disorders, does not have an obvious genetic defect. In fact, there may not be a relationship between what is seen clinically and genetically in autism. It was said that in autism, there are no treatments; therefore small improvements can be revolutionary. Measurements of outcomes in drug developments in autism research are also quite complex. Parent warriors are often scientists who were touched by autism in a personal way, as is directly seen on this panel. Social media has made broad-reaching clinical trials possible, connecting with other parent warriors from far and afield. Crowd source funding is also utilized.</p>
<p>A collective goal amongst the panelists is to better understand the molecular defect(s) of autism, and to determine a way to objectively measure outcomes of experimental treatment. One panelist offers the possibility to discover treatable idiopathic subtypes of autism. Perhaps inflammation plays a causal role in some subtypes of autism that can be targeted with effective therapies. Collectively grappling with the impressive and challenging future of autism research, it does not seem that any of these panelists are capable of limiting themselves in their pursuit to define, treat and end this disease. In the end, the moderator, Ron Suskind, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author and Director of the Project on Public Narrative at Harvard University, also rallied for the societal inclusion of those already autism-afflicted, highlighting the strengths or passions of differently-abled people, while seeking creative adaptations and treatments to enhance their quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Pyschiatric Targets: Finally New Mechanisms</strong><br />
Today, most of us know – either as family members, friends or work associates – people who suffer from some form of psychiatric disease. Yet, the delivery of care and the corresponding investment in research, infrastructure, and medical support suffer from a disproportionate lack of resources, compared to other targeted health programs such as cancer. As was noted in the earlier session on neurostimulation, venture capital investment for psychiatric diseases is less than 10% of the cancer investment. Maurizio Fava, M.D., Executive Vice Chair, MGH Psychiatry and Slater Family Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, added that the drug therapies available today (mostly monoamines) have been available for years, and very few new drugs have made it to Phase 3 trials. Other participants contributed their analyses about why the industry has not championed new therapies.</p>
<p>Deborah Dunsire, M.D., as CEO of FORUM Pharmaceuticals, stated “Show me the target.” Her assessment of the industry is that the therapies and outcomes lack the tools to successfully predict the risk of the investment. Fava commented that the placebo effect resulted in a number of Phase 3 trials being abandoned.<br />
One theme was the need for better biological markers that can be used in providing more accurate and actionable diagnoses. David Silbersweig, Chairman, Psychiatry at BWH and Stanley Cobb Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in his opening comments, referred to the difficulty of working with patients where many of the symptoms are self-reported. He also pointed out how recent research has identified the high level of interaction between the executive functions and the limbic system – which makes some of the traditional categories less useful. Instead, he emphasized that new methods have explored the role of the environment along with current therapies. Part of this discussion was also the need for better metrics for outcomes.</p>
<p>Another theme was the emerging use of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapies). Corey McCann, M.D., Ph.D., Founder and CEO, Pear Therapeutics, discussed the approach his company has taken in merging software-based CBT technology with various drug therapies. The panel discussed the application of CBT to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the underlying mechanisms that deal with fear circuitry. CBT – using contemporary game technology – allows the patient to work through his or her fear experience so that the narrative can be selectively disassociated from the emotional response. PTSD has gained a lot of recent attention in the industry, partly because of the need to treat the veteran population. McCann stated that studies have shown that CBT plus an antidepressant have treated depression better than either one alone. It also has the benefit of working with several existing drugs, and it can be deployed for new indications without some of the overhead currently associated with FDA approval of new drugs.<br />
Other topics covered included addiction, active and passive monitoring using cell phone technology, and imaging. The panel was generally upbeat about the future.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep and Consciousness: Clinical Need Versus Safety</strong><br />
Sleep serves as the bedrock of good health. And poor sleep, either in duration, quality or continuity, may have significant negative implications for overall health.</p>
<p>While we sleep, parts of our brain are quite active. Deep, slow-wave sleep at the beginning of a sleep cycle helps to consolidate memory, while REM stage sleep that occurs much later in the sleep cycle helps us integrate what we have learned. REM sleep assists with the development of insight and understanding. And when we are asleep, the brain’s own drainage system removes harmful metabolites like amyloid beta.</p>
<p>A number of factors get in the way of sleep. Many of us are over-caffeinated and spend too much time in front of TV and other device screens. The light emitted by these devices interferes with the normal role of melatonin and delays the onset of sleep. Millions of others, many unaware, suffer from interrupted breathing during sleep – sleep apnea. Still others face chronic disorders of insomnia and narcolepsy. Chronic pain and psychiatric illnesses can also disrupt sleep.</p>
<p>Research is needed to identify biomarkers so that personalized therapies can be developed. Intensive effort and significant resources will be needed to see if it is possible to come up with a blood test to indicate who among us is at greater risk for a given sleep disorder. It was once thought that all sleep apnea, for example, was the same. Research has shown there to be a number of subtypes. Continued work to indentify subtypes will help develop more effective therapies.</p>
<p>Many of the wearable computing devices like Fitbit and sleep monitors are generating great interest. As more and more individuals are collecting data, including on sleep habits, patterns are emerging. This data may also be used for diagnostic and treatment purposes. However, these devices are early prototypes and as such, can produce erroneous data or even be “tricked” into producing false results. As they become more sophisticated, they may be able to offer more insight into sleep and other health indicators.</p>
<p>Exciting new areas to be explored include the genetics of sleep pathology. This coincides with the groundswell of interest in personalized medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Parkinson’s: Finally Crossing the Therapeutic Threshold</strong><br />
The first part of this panel focused on the need for better biological markers which would result in enhanced diagnostic capability, and the second part dived into current therapies for Parkinson’s disease. Michael Schwarzchild, M.D. Ph.D., Chair, Parkinson Study Group Executive Committee at MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, and Professor Neurology, Harvard Medical School, opened the session by providing an overview of what Parkinson’s is and its prevalence in the population (second most common disease behind Alzheimer’s). He also reviewed some of the recent findings, particularly in the emergence of some of the genetic clues and their complex interactions with environmental factors. New insights have been gained on the progress of the disease and early diagnosis. He stressed that the most typical symptom of Parkinson’s – tremors and other motor disorders – is not necessarily the first manifestation of the disease (for example, sleep disorders, depression, etc.) As he remarked later in the session, there is still no unifying hypothesis for Parkinson’s.<br />
The difficulty in identifying biomarkers was complicated by the effect of patients already in treatment. Some studies have taken 10 years and have been very costly. Clemens Scherzer, M.D., Director, Neurogenomics Lab and Parkinson Personalized Medicine Program, Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Massachusetts General Hospital, and Associate Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, described the collaborative approach his team has taken at Harvard and the positive results they have achieved. Results are now measured in weeks rather than years. Todd Sherer, CEO of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, also championed collaborative research and described some successful programs they have run. So far, the strongest markers have been genetic.</p>
<p>Current therapies seem to be centered on the continued use of dopamine-based strategies. Scherzer noted that of 35 recent trials, only a handful include disease-modifying drugs. The improvements are more focused on better delivery mechanisms, so that a patient can gain relief in a matter of minutes rather than in 30 to 40 minutes (based on inhalationm versus oral intake). More work is also being done on integrating non-motor symptoms into the treatment portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>New Leaders at the Table: Filling the Gap Through Philanthropy</strong><br />
Henry McCance, dynamic speaker and Co-Founder of Cure Alzheimer’s Fund eloquently defined this nonprofit organization, founded in 2004, by several families who were frustrated by the slow pace of research. This fund is a new venture-based entity created to speed research and exclusively focus on finding a cure, leveraging successful returns that de-risk research and thus become more attractive to public funding sources.<br />
Meryl Comer, President of the Geoffrey Beene Foundation’s Alzheimer’s Initiative, spoke of her role as long-term caregiver of her afflicted husband and her realization that she needed to turn the suffering into purpose. Comer spoke of actively changing the direction and pace of medical research, by mining public databases, or “big data,” and not focusing on reinventing the wheel, as well as utilizing collaborative technologies to help foster data collection and analysis. The Initiative has generated more than $4.8 million so far, in support of awareness programs and early diagnostic and treatment research.</p>
<p>Nancy Frates, mother of Pete Frates, described how their family enveloped themselves in philanthropic relationships that banded together to amplify funding for ALS research. A fellow ALS sufferer came across the Ice Bucket Challenge and brought it to Pete’s attention, and the Frates family quickly and efficiently used social media to use the Challenge to spread the word, as well as to raise the funds to be proactive and accelerate ALS research.<br />
CEO of Forma Therapeutics, Steven Tregay, spoke of how Forma is helping to transform the drug discovery process through collaborations in pharma.</p>
<p>Jeff Walker, Vice Chair, United Nations Envoy Office of Health and Finance and Malaria, shared that he just lost his father t Alzheimer’s last Friday. He spoke of pointing out to investors that their investment “return” is invaluable.<br />
Bill Sahlman, Senior Associate Dean of Harvard Business School, brilliantly defines the biggest “data dumps: on everyone’s hips, the cell phone. The importance of gathering information on a big scale is very important, and cell phones are ideally placed for this purpose. He does not feel that privacy concerns should get in the way of utilizing these ubiquitous tools for research purposes.</p>
<p>The takeaway message of this panel was that in an age where we are living longer lives, it may be that it’s not if you get Alzheimer’s, it’s when, and we should all be active investors in its prevention, treatment and cure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second day of the World Medical Innovation Forum continued to build momentum on the Forum’s mission — providing a venue for imperative conversation among academic, private, government and patient/consumer communities. The agenda set forth today brought together stakeholders across disciplines — patients living with neurologic conditions and leaders in academic medical research, private biotechnology, and government. The one-on-one panel format paved the way for candid insight into where the field of neurosciences has been for the past 30 years and where it is heading, at an accelerated pace, via collaboration and conversation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Clinical Demonstrations </em></strong><br />
The first session started early and strong with demonstrations from two of neuroscience medicine’s most promising tools, the AMIGO Suite and NeuroSwitch. The AMIGO Suite is a $20 million multi-modality operating room pioneered at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). This robust theater is intraoperative imaging at its best, the concept first conceived at BWH in the 1990s. It is equipped with CT, MR, fluoroscopy, among others, and the world’s only intraoperative PET/CT scan. Suites featuring intraoperative imaging are now adopted widely across the United States and the world.</p>
<p>The goal of these suites is to make surgery safer by assisting surgeons in distinguishing normal versus cancerous tissue. This guidance, along with superior imaging technique, allows neurosurgeons to contour a mass with unprecedented approximation and aids in real-time clinical decision-making. Suites like AMIGO are multi-specialty and can be applied to systems other than the brain and therefore, engage a wide array of the clinical community. Transforming a maximally invasive procedure into a minimally invasive one and being able to operate on a formerly inoperable patient are the underlying incentives for using such suites.</p>
<p>What are brain surgeons currently excited about? More precision for better outcomes. Metabolite-guided surgery through mass spectroscopy, delivery of drugs into the central nervous system (CNS), and laser hyperthermia to destroy tumors. The AMIGO Suite is able to use any type of instrument, metallic or not. A versatile OR is a vehicle of the future, and the world’s eyes are on BWH and the AMIGO suite.</p>
<p>NeuroSwitch is unlike the typical communication aids available on the market. It gets past the physical interface (buttons, keyboards, clickers) and uses movements and EEG data to control a computer device. Patients with locked-in syndrome (LIS), most commonly found in ALS, are able to use NeuroSwitch to regain control of their self-expression. The market size is growing – 35,000 patients suffer from ALS in the United States, with 5,000 new diagnoses annually. The ability for patients to communicate with not only their loved ones, but also with the world online is paramount for them. Patients who use NeuroSwitch gave live demonstrations, raving about NeuroSwitch and how it allows them to keep their passions, like book blogging or 3D printing, alive. When motor control diminishes, sophisticated, hands-free communication aids are mandatory. With features like the ones NeuroSwitch boasts, patients are able to stay connected with their families and communities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Patient One-on-One</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1499" src="https://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM-300x200.jpg" alt="Ann Romney" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM-150x100.jpg 150w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM-120x80.jpg 120w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM-93x62.jpg 93w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6858-SM.jpg 1368w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
</em></strong>Serving as the official launch of the Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases at BWH, Ann Romney spoke to Forum attendees about her personal journey with multiple sclerosis (MS). She was diagnosed in 1998 and expressed how fortunate she was to have received early and aggressive treatment at BWH. She is now currently in remission and on no medication, a state of health not realized by many other patients who suffer from neurologic disease worldwide. She maintains her stellar health by rigorous fitness regimens and diets, as well as a spiritual and mental wellbeing that is fostered by her passion for horseback riding. She credits both physicians at BWH and her dedicated supporters who were there for her on the campaign trail during her husband’s past presidential bid.</p>
<p>The Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases will support research and innovation in MS, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s Disease, and brain tumors. She hopes that this horizontal model will instigate interdisciplinary collaboration. The overlap in many neurological illnesses calls for a different approach and to break down the silos of disease cures and therapy research and development efforts. There is power in numbers, and she encourages all who are affected by neurological disease to join her new social media campaign by using the hash tag, #50MillionFaces, on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Alzheimer’s Phoenix: New Technologies, New Economics<br />
</em></strong>This panel of esteemed and diverse AD experts shed light on the current theories of disease causes and what to expect on the journey to a cure. All were very optimistic and agreed that we are close to disease-modifying therapies that could be marketable as soon as five years from now. It has taken decades to validate the two-tiered pathology of AD in amyloid-beta (a-beta) and tau protein aggregation. The future lies in combining these theories into parallel therapies to enhance clinical effect. Base inhibitors have been found to be very promising and are currently the most competitive targets in the industry. When given to compliant patients for a year, a-beta was eliminated almost entirely. This is the epitome of reverse translational medicine – aiding the immune system in recognizing these destructive protein aggregates.</p>
<p>As the underlying causes of AD become clearer, early and personalized treatment for patients has become more realistic. In the autopsies of people who died of suspected AD, almost 1/3 of their brains were seen to be damaged. According to the speakers, clinicians must realize that AD is malicious organ failure that starts decades before being symptomatic, if at all. The heterogeneity of the population with AD in years to come will help evolve treatment. It will not be long before we are treating AD patients based on their own specific symptoms and biology. Today’s speakers advised that clinicians need to start utilizing a risk-assessment profile to plan beyond the long prodromal period and optimistically provide a risk “score” as early as age 40.</p>
<p>Where are there room for improvements in AD care? There has to be greater coordination among payers to coordinate cost-effectiveness. The late-stage AD patient requires 24-hour care, multiple caregivers, and an extensive clinical team. The advances to come will hopefully allow patients to maintain more independence and a greater quality of life and have care at an as-needed basis. Investigators need to focus their efforts on finding the right genes and biomarkers for drug development. Non-pharmacological interventions should be integrated into care and be viewed just as importantly as drugs. Poor diet and scarce exercise cannot be compensated for by better drugs. The stratification of AD patients as at-risk, non-symptomatic, early-stage, or late-stage, require individualized care and treatment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regeneration, Cell Therapy, and Neurocare: Products? Delivery?<br />
</em></strong>Regenerative medicine is recreating cells that are deficient, diseased, or missing. The use of stem cells and cell-based therapies is still controversial and presents moral and ethical issues as well as regulatory hurdles. However, it is undeniable that the brain is incredibly “plastic” and boasts an elegant biofeedback system. To use cells to correct a dysfunction requires great specificity. Cell-based therapies have the potential to be applied across disciplines in spinal cord injury, diabetes, and blood dyscrasias. In spinal cord injury, “cross-correction” can produce enough of a missing enzyme in defective neurons for them to remain viable. Diabetics can be unleashed from a life support of administered insulin with the replacement of defunct beta cells in the pancreas. In inherited disorders like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, gene editing can reprogram cells to be embryonic, enabling patients to essentially “get their cells back.” The targeted diseases for stem cell research are typically ones that have no treatments; any work in this field, therefore, will address a large unmet need.</p>
<p>There are two types of cells used in regenerative therapies: embryonic, or immature cells derived from embryos, and “adult” cells that come from a formed organ. Embryonic cells can potentially produce any cell type in the body – providing a wealth of possibility yet also result in the chance of tumorgenecity, or the primitive cell developing into a tumor. There are ways to address this by pre-determining cells or turning on “suicide genes” to kill the cell once it starts to express tumorgenecity. This controversial technique has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives but will not be adapted into practice if headway cannot be made by industry and academia, together, in addressing the treatment risks.</p>
<p><strong><em>CEO One-on-One Sessions</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1500" src="https://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115-300x200.jpg" alt="Robert Bradway" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115-300x200.jpg 300w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115-768x512.jpg 768w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115-150x100.jpg 150w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115-120x80.jpg 120w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7115-93x62.jpg 93w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
</em></strong>The personal one-on-one accounts continued throughout the day with candid conversations between leaders in the private biotechnology industry and government. Robert Bradway, CEO of Amgen, and George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO of Biogen, reflected on the challenges and successes to date in identifying and producing novel therapies for devastating neurologic diseases.</p>
<p>Bradway said that Amgen is a leader in drug development across various diseases like chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and the company is increasingly interested in getting more involved in the neurosciences. Some drugs in their current pipeline are early-stage treatments for schizophrenia, AD, and chronic pain. Amgen is currently active in genetics, and Bradway sees a sustaining trend in favoring genetics for informing drug development.</p>
<p>Bradway discussed Amgen’s acquisition of Decode Genetics at length, emphasizing the imperative role collaboration plays in translational research—an interdisciplinary research style that is currently guiding the industry. Bradway noted there has been recent feverish collaboration as government withdraws more funding for basic research. We are seeing this withdrawal because of a decades-long steady monetary decline. More investment in genetics can reverse this by quickening the drug development process and making it more efficacious. Per Bradway’s account, Amgen is looking ahead to identify and develop therapies based on the genetic and molecular understanding of a disease and its pathway. As industry at large is seen further reducing its commitment to discovery research, Amgen proclaims it is not shrinking back.</p>
<p>Scangos’ account provided insider details into Biogen’s past and current Phase 2 and 3 trials for ALS, MS and AD therapies. Scangos praised the role academic collaborations have had in driving the talent, direction, and mission of successful biotechnology research and development. Scangos also shed light on Biogen’s biggest concern for the next half decade—the current environmental context that medical research operates in. Thoughtful public policy will be necessary to fulfill the potential of this pivotal time in medical history—with aligned talent, resources, and a greater understanding of neurologic diseases than ever before.</p>
<p><strong><em>Secretary One-on-One</em></strong></p>
<p><em><a href="http://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1501" src="https://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296-300x200.jpg" alt="Sylvia Mathews Burwell" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296-300x200.jpg 300w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296-768x512.jpg 768w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296-150x100.jpg 150w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296-120x80.jpg 120w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A7296-93x62.jpg 93w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
</em>The one-on-one conversation with Honorable Sylvia Matthews Burwell, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, echoed Scangos’ glimpse into the importance of public policy. Secretary Burwell emphasized the similar priorities all entities hold—affordable, accessible, life-changing therapies for patients. By changing health care pay systems, implementing integrated care systems, and moving forward with data collection, analytics, and protection, the Department of Health and Human Services is optimistic about the next phases of neuroscience care and beyond.</p>
<p><em><strong>Neurostimulation: First Line Therapy?</strong></em><br />
What is neuromodulation and why does it work? Neuromodulation is the use of various kinds of electric signals to restore the brain to a more normal state. It is a broad and emerging field; we are on the verge of a revolution with treating diseases such a Parkinson&#8217;s, epilepsy and OCD. This type of treatment has been around for decades but has recently re-emerged through new findings in neuroscience research.</p>
<p>Speakers said that in the past, neuromodulation treatments worked, but nobody knew why. Although the field is much more developed now, patients are still hesitant to embrace this technology due to its highly invasive nature. Panelists mentioned that up to 15 percent of Parkinson’s patients receive these implants, but there still needs to be additional education and a shift in mindset in order for this type of treatment to be more widely adopted – a challenge that may be overcome with time. ​</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Partners HealthCare kicked off its inaugural World Medical Innovation Forum in Boston on April 27 with a truly international presence, bringing together over 1,000 attendees from 18 countries to discuss and advance the state of neuroscience research, patient care, and delivery. The first day of this three-day event also highlighted the role of collaboration and partnering across stakeholders in venture capital, academia, life sciences, and health care to ensure financial sustainability amidst increasing cost pressures and constraints in funding.</p>
<p>Neurological diseases are particularly prominent and represent a huge, unaddressed disease burden across global societies, and today’s panels provided a multifaceted view of the current state of care for neurological diseases, accompanied by bold proposals for what the future setting of neurocare will entail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Cafe, Welcome</strong></p>

<p>The day kicked off on when attendees gathered over lunch for a roundtable discussion on a specific topic, moderated by a champion in that field, called the Discovery Cafe. Topics ranged from psychiatric care to information systems and how they all can contribute to innovation in the neurosciences. Rich, interdisciplinary discussion flowed among clinicians, industry experts, policymakers, and researchers. The Discovery Cafe provided a platform to transform mingling and networking into purposeful interaction between fellow attendees.</p>
<p><a href="http://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1488" src="https://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396-300x200.jpg" alt="Welcome - 1" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396-300x200.jpg 300w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396-768x512.jpg 768w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396-150x100.jpg 150w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396-120x80.jpg 120w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6396-93x62.jpg 93w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Attendees were officially ushered into their upcoming three days of neurological innovation by CEO of Partners HealthCare, David Torchiana, M.D., and Chief Academic Officer of Partners HealthCare, Anne Klibanski, M.D., as well as by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. A significant fraction of Partners HealthCare’s $1.5 billion enterprise is work in the neurosciences. The audience was called to action to push the frontiers of medicine against the backdrop of world-renowned facilities, scientists, and clinicians that is Boston.</p>
<p><strong>Neurocare, Neuromarkets, and Neuro Challenges </strong><br />
The day’s first panel, “Neurocare, Neuromarkets, and Neuro Challenges,” cited early detection and prophylactic care as key needs across Alzheimer’s and psychiatric care. Scott Rauch, President and Psychiatrist in Chief at McLean Hospital, stated it’s the rule rather than the exception that patients are suffering from psychiatric diseases for years before they are detected. These observations, however, were tempered amidst real-world reservations from patients, who may not want to know about genetic predispositions or had privacy concerns amidst proposals for earlier screening and detection.</p>
<p>Clinical neuroscience leaders across Partners HealthCare were called to dive into the past, present, and future of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to share how far we have come in the field and how very much there is still left to discover. A common thread throughout was that stigma is stalling. The medicalization of psychiatric illnesses has been a remarkable jump forward &#8211; clinicians are now viewing bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc., as diseases with an originating pathology like how we view hypertension or diabetes. We are now seeing the beginning of stigma erosion in public figures and celebrities stepping forward to advocate for these illnesses.</p>
<p>With this new clinical perspective comes the challenge of screening. When will AD be uniformly screened, like colon cancer? To reach patients at the primary care level is key to early intervention. It is widely understood now that changes in the brain due to AD occur decades before symptoms first appear. Engaging at-risk patients earlier and understanding how inflammation in the immune system contributes to its spread will be of note in the future of AD care.</p>
<p>In neurosurgery, advances are more technical but no less exciting. There is more precision than ever before in imaging and in the miniaturization of instruments. Gels and focused ultrasounds are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver the appropriate amount of drugs to a specific location in the brain. These advances contribute to the minimization of collateral brain damage during surgery. As neurosurgery becomes safer and more seamless, we will see patients with better outcomes.</p>
<p>Not only are we able to enter the brain with newfound surgical specificity, but we are also now at the advent of specificity in neurogenetics. The future of neurocare will be linking outcomes and treatments to the genotypes of patients. Researchers are beginning to acknowledge the overlap that many of these neurodegenerative diseases share in similar genetic predispositions. This can be translated into clinical trial design by finding out how successful patients are different genetically and then designing the next trial based on that data. Lowering the burden of becoming involved in clinical trials is key to the advancement of research. Another challenge to neurocare is how to expand access to treatment. Telemedicine plays a big role with programs such as cognitive behavioral therapy being available online. Our personal devices like phones and tablets hold the answer to remote monitoring. It is how we contextualize this deluge of “big data” that will shape the trajectory of the neuromarket in upcoming years.</p>
<p><strong>“Over the Horizon: Witnessing Disruption of Neurocare”</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1489" src="https://medforum16.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594-300x200.jpg" alt="Over the Horizon - 1" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594-300x200.jpg 300w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594-768x512.jpg 768w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594-150x100.jpg 150w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594-120x80.jpg 120w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5H8A6594-93x62.jpg 93w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
The day’s second panel, “Over the Horizon: Witnessing the Disruption of Neurocare,” generated bold predictions across industry and public research organizations, proposing an array of traditional therapeutics, electroceutical, brain-machine interface approaches to treat human disease and augment lifestyles, even repositioning the nervous system as the vehicle to deliver and refine treatment for patients. As Geoffrey Ling, Director of Biological Technologies Office at DARPA pointed out, experiments highlighting cognitive control of prosthetic limbs point to a potential applications that could surpass the limits of our sensory organs and other exogenous tools to improve patient cognition and lifestyles, especially in states of frailty observed later in life.</p>
<p>This provocative panel leapt into novel ideas that the panelists believe are just at the cusp of neurological innovation. These neuro-forecasters pooled their collective knowledge from biotechnology and big pharma to present the most cutting-edge and controversial of work. The audience was advised to abandon any preconceived notions on how innovation works, citing that humans did not know that cell phones would be so ingrained into our lifestyle a decade ago. Panelists pushed that in the future of the patient-empowered age, everyone will be sequencing their genome, even from birth. The best drugs will then be gene-modifiers, and the concept of a “drug” could completely vanish as combined strategies make their way into therapeutics and care plans. Clinicians will soon be prescribing drugs with apps or drugs with software. The concept of a “dose” will change as we add different interfaces into neurocare.</p>
<p>One of these novel “neural interfaces” is the concept of “electroceuticals,” or devices that deliver electrical stimulation at the level of peripheral nerves. These exquisitely specific devices will be smaller than a grain of rice and allow us to control our neurocircuitry. It is up to investigators of the future to map the neurocircuitry of diseases. The concept that the central nervous system is synergistic with pathology throughout the body is one that may be difficult for clinicians to adapt to. For example, it is clear that diabetes is a metabolic disorder but how clear is it that it is a neurological one? Imagine the possibility of treating an illness with “information” in addition to drugs.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) may be characteristic of science fiction movies, but is nothing to fear, but rather embrace. The Stone Age and Iron Age were eras of tool adaptation, and so the expected path is that the Digital Age will move onto AI as we “adapt” to the synergy of brain and machine. By doing this, we are “liberating our bodies” and allowing our cognitive capacity to accomplish more. Our future lies in the “Internet of things,” or rather than having exogenous control in the form of cellphones, tablets, etc., we will have internal cognitive control over our environment. This is not a new concept; brain-controlled prosthetics are allowing amputees to control limbs. Phones and computers may be a thing of the past one day, and “smart” environments will take their place.</p>
<p>Along with enhancing our environments, enhancing the normal human condition is pushing the frontiers of medicine. Becoming bionic may mean unprecedented longevity for today’s youth. To achieve this. we must understand what is the “average” condition and why is it that we age and become ill. Have our genes not adapted to today’s environment and lifestyle? If so, perhaps we can identify those genes that cause disease and aging and “turn them off.” Ethical issues will be an obstacle to many of these radical ideas and must be addressed before becoming mainstream.</p>
<p>So, what must happen in order for these concepts to be implemented in the clinical setting? Building the technological platforms and understanding the revolutionary biology must happen simultaneously. Industry stakeholders have to own this work in order for it to make it into practice. As the population grows older, public pressure mounts with the heavy societal burdens of neurological disease.</p>
<p>For both the research and innovation communities, key challenges and questions arise: Why is therapeutic development usually a second career? Why is it not viewed more urgently in the minds of clinicians? What barriers are holding them back from tapping into this rich field? For innovators trying to propel disruptive interventions like electroceuticals into the care space, what will it take for consumers and patients to choose devices over drugs? IUDs and implants prove to be the most effective contraceptive method, yet pills are the most widely preferred method today. Will the idea of “invasiveness” change over time as the body interacts more with technology?</p>
<p>Only time can answer these pressing questions on the minds of today’s innovators and researchers. Biology is becoming more of a quantitative science. “Coding” our nerves and gene editing has the potential to become a universal standard of treatment. “Cognitive resilience,” or the fielding of symptoms of AD, for example, can become a reality and greatly impact the quality of life of patients. At the intersection of therapeutics and technology lie a wealth of knowledge that we do not yet know how to harvest.</p>
<p><strong>Transformation and Innovation: Conflict? Collision? Opportunity?</strong></p>

Chief Executives from provider, pharmaceutical, and medical device stakeholders took the floor to highlight stakeholder considerations, opportunities, and needs in the face of a decrease in inflation adjusted NIH funding and population health burdens. As Jeff Leiden, M.D., Ph.D., CEO of Vertex, noted, the irony is that the science has never been better, but the funding has never been worse.</p>
<p>While undertones in funding and an increasingly difficult operating environment where apparent throughout the day, the panelists shared a universal optimism for the current state of medicine and an excitement in the potential advances to come, often pointing to current market forces as motivators for improvements in treatment and care. As Leiden noted, the health care community has a great story to tell when it comes to the value and impact that the system brings to society; we just need to focus on communicating that story to the public.</p>

<p>The almost $700 billion annual spend in neurodegenerative diseases tells a story of a global community struck by an array of stubborn neurological conditions and challenged by drug discovery, delivery, care, regulatory protocols, and economic and organizational practices serving at cross-purposes. Yet, there was something inspirational and I dare say hopeful about the presenters’ opinions of what’s to come.</p>
<p>Technology, transparency, and passion appeared central to the secret sauce. Much was stated about the power of smart devices allowing the organic evolution of large data sets to evolve and yield insight and action in a scalable fashion not seen till now.</p>
<p>Second, transparency, or specifically data and process transparency, appeared thematic as another dimension supporting progress. That is, having enhanced access and data deployment through analytics, machine interfaces, and control mechanisms further influenced interventions. This may, in cases, lead to more precise mapping, stimulating, manipulating, and modulating of circuits, genes, and varied organs in a more predictive, synergistic fashion &#8212; yielding greater value and utility.</p>
<p>Additionally, the collective process and arrangement of organized inquiry, aggregation, experimentation, and delivery may interestingly be compared to a very different but similarly transparent process.</p>
<p>In the food and beverage industry, the fast-casual restaurant segment is very popular. Chipotle Restaurant, the leader in this segment, allows diners to self-select and view the assembling of an array of diverse ingredients for a given order. The interaction effects of the employee and customer publicly engaging in the co-design and build effort yields more satisfaction, efficiency, and taste with both creator and consumer, as noted in the restaurant surveys. Similarly, in health care research, such increased process transparency is no less immaterial in the discovery-delivery value chain.</p>
<p>Third, it seems the very human quality of passion and / or emotion, can also play an out-sized role in the direction and dynamics of next gen neuroscience. Many stories about the fear surrounding Alzheimer’s is self-evident here. As described, we have all heard of some version of the hapless wonderer in the parking lot seeking their car, keys or both, much to one’s frustration. This example, perhaps associated with Alzheimer’s, can easily and obviously be substituted with other neurodegenerative diseases, as well.</p>
<p>On the hopeful side, passion was referenced as a motivator that has led to an activist public seeking answers. Their intent has further engaged some to experiment in varied ways that on occasion has yielded surprising, timely, and consequential data.</p>
<p>While there is much to hope for, there are equally many daunting challenges requiring attention. Certainly, as always, understanding the fundamental root causes, relationships, pathways, and protocols of the disease state is central. However, just as daunting on a more macro-level is the institutional – organizational arrangement in moving beyond silos to varied operating forms of collaboration, coordination, “co-opitition,” and disruption.</p>
<p>The clarion call for innovation at a cellular or genomic level can also be matched with one for social innovation. That is the experimentation for team and organizational architectures to have more appropriately employed decision rights, accountability mechanisms, resource management, and role agility &#8212; all in the service of empowering knowledge creation and application in a more expedient, practical and generative fashion when called for.</p>
<p>Finally, economic innovation is perhaps recognized as an equally stubborn yet central player in creating an optimal future for balancing the incentives for payers, payees, and providers. Agile business and operating models, governance mechanisms, and investment models will need to be created and adjusted as the field continues to mature at different stages of capability and practice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>New Hopes for Alzheimer’s disease featured at World Medical Innovation Forum</strong></p>
<p>Six Reasons why the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s study (the &#8220;A4 study&#8221;) with Reisa Sperling, MD, BWH, Director of Clinical Research, Memory Disorders Unit,<br />
Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital is making Strides</p>
<p><strong>1. The novel concept of treating patients before they are symptomatic</strong></p>
<p>Instead of waiting until patients develop full blown Alzheimer’s disease, the A4 study has been proactive. The A4 study targets older individuals with evidence of early Alzheimer’s changes in their brain but who do not yet have symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, in hopes of preventing memory decline. This is the first time in history of AD research that a prevention trial has been undertaken in asymptomatic individuals identified with biomarker evidence of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p><strong>2. The use of an anti-amyloid antibody</strong></p>
<p>The humanized monoclonal antibody, solanezumab, which has already be testing in two Phase 3 trials at the stage of Alzheimers’ dementia, binds to soluble forms of amyloid and can help its clearance of it from the brain. The previous trials in dementia patients showed some modest evidence of slowing of decline in the mildest subgroup. The hope is treating 5-10 years earlier with this antibody can bend the curve of decline.</p>
<p><strong>3. It’s empowering patients to manage their health and potential risk for developing AD</strong></p>
<p>The A4 study has made people more aware of options for treatment and potential cures in the works. Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is not a death sentence and clinicians and researchers are working hard through this trial and other to get closer to finding a cure.</p>
<p><strong>4.It’s getting people talking about Alzheimer’s disease (more people learning about what Alzheimer’s actually is, informing families at risk, communities, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>Almost everyone knows someone, or has a friend who has known someone affected by Alzheimer’s disease. More and more people are hearing the words “Alzheimer’s disease” in conversation but do not exactly know what it means. These trials are giving the disease much more press, and increasing awareness. This is beneficial in many aspects such as fundraising for research and recruiting people for this study.</p>
<p><strong>5. It involves collaborations</strong></p>
<p>The A4 trial is sponsored by a public-private partnership involving the National Institutes of Health, Eli Lilly, and several philanthropic organizations. The A4 study is also working with other prevention trial efforts in genetic at-risk populations around the world to ensure they can learn as much as possible from these trials.</p>
<p><strong>6. It emphasizes its urgency</strong></p>
<p>Most people are not aware of the urgency of action for Alzheimer’s disease. One of nine people over the age of 65 has the disease, and as our population ages, Alzheimer’s disease is becoming a public health epidemic. If we do not do something about it, this disease has the potential to bankrupt our healthcare system. It is critical to increase awareness and send the message something that can be done to cure Alzheimer’s if we act now. Attend this year’s World Medical Innovation Forum on April 27-29, 2015.
