<p class="" data-reactid="283">by WBUR</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="283">June 8, 2018- So far, the digital revolution has mostly been a disappointment in health care. Doctors stare at their screens instead of us. Specialists and emergency rooms still don’t have all our records.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="284">But artificial intelligence, big data analytics and deep learning are converging on health care in a big way, information technology experts insist. The changes have already begun. And if and when they really take off, such convergence of biology and technology should bring about a complete transformation of medical care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="286">“My personal perspective would be in three to five years, the huge majority of patients will be touched one way or [an]other with some AI-related system, whether they know it or not,” says Chris Coburn, chief innovation officer at Partners HealthCare, who recently led a three-day conference on the topic of artificial intelligence, or AI. “The scope of the potential benefit is at times not easily even imagined.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="287">Coburn and others cite numerous examples where artificial intelligence is already improving health care:</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="288">&#8212; Digital visual analysis is beginning to replace pathologists at identifying dangerous tumors.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="289">&#8212; Devices are increasingly able to monitor patients at home to catch problems before they become serious.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="290">&#8212; Pharmaceutical companies like Amgen and Novartis are using deep learning and artificial intelligence to shorten their drug development process and improve their odds of successfully bringing a drug to market.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="291">&#8212; Cellphones and watch-like mobile devices are increasingly being used to monitor healthy people for changes that might indicate impending problems.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="292">&#8212; And in hospitals, algorithms can help indicate which patients need immediate attention and which should be left alone to rest.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="293">&#8220;Our patient monitoring and guardian algorithms can actually predictively say how a patient is doing,&#8221; says Frans van Houten, head of Royal Philips, the Dutch conglomerate now focused almost entirely on health care technologies.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="294">Houten, whose company is in the process of consolidating its U.S. research operations in Cambridge, says digital algorithms can predict which patients are vulnerable to life-threatening infections and which to heart attacks.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="295">“And that allows the health system to proactively direct staff to the patients that need [care], versus the patients that don’t,” he says. “So our technology can play a big role for precision care and raising productivity.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="296">Similarly, Colin Hill runs a Cambridge company, GNS Healthcare, which analyzes vast amounts of patient data to derive information that can improve care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="297">“We’re on a path to turning the lights on and revealing what works for whom,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And by getting at the underlying mechanisms of these diseases, we can now stop the guesswork. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s really exciting for me.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="298">His company recently used genetic data from a large number of patients with the blood cancer multiple myeloma to identify patterns in those who were helped by a costly, potentially dangerous bone marrow transplant. If the findings are validated, patients whose genetics suggest they wouldn’t benefit could be spared the time, energy, expense and dashed hopes of a fruitless procedure.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="299">Thanks to improvements in artificial intelligence, Hill says, “we’re now able to learn that kind of causality &#8212; those kinds of cause-effect relationships &#8212; straight from real-world data.”</p>
</section>
<section class="article-section--content hang-punctuation article-section--island" data-reactid="300">
<blockquote class="article-pullquote" data-reactid="301">
<p class="article-pullquote-text" data-reactid="302">&#8220;As a society, we are coming to grips with the fact that we have a health care system that costs far too much and delivers far too little&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><cite class="article-pullquote-attribution" data-reactid="304">Colin Hill, GNS Healthcare</cite></p></blockquote>
</section>
<section class="article-section--content hang-punctuation article-section--centered" data-reactid="305">
<p class="" data-reactid="306">Hopefully, this will also save money, which is driving the current interest, Hill says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="307">“What&#8217;s changed is the convergence of both the data and the technology capabilities,” he says. “And I think the environment&#8217;s also changed. As a society, we are coming to grips with the fact that we have a health care system that costs far too much and delivers far too little and it is ultimately not sustainable the way it is.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="308">Nobel Laureate and MIT Institute professor Phil Sharp has an even broader vision of this convergence: It’s not just computer science and biology that are converging, but engineering, physics, material science and agriculture too, he says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="309">“Life science is part of all of those processes and bringing physicists and engineering and information technology together to integrate life science with the translation to solving those problems is what convergence is about,” Sharp says. “It&#8217;ll be decades of exciting science and exciting technology.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="310"><strong>&#8216;It Doesn&#8217;t Always Go The Way We Hope&#8217;</strong></p>
<p class="" data-reactid="311">Despite its potential, some people say that artificial intelligence is the future of health care — and always will be. Skepticism remains high because of problems with the electronic health record, which has taken years longer than expected to become functional and constructive.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="312">“We hope that things are going to go well. But specifically in health care it doesn&#8217;t always go the way we hope,” says Andrew Beam, an instructor and junior faculty member in the department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="313">GNS Healthcare&#8217;s Hill says he finds it annoying when tech people assume it should be easy to bring change to health care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="314">&#8220;When folks come from the tech world thinking that they&#8217;re going to come and build the iPhone of human disease and health care, one of the reasons why they stumble with it is because the complexity of these systems is just beyond anything we&#8217;ve dealt with,” Hill says. &#8220;It’s a fundamentally different problem.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="315">There is no room for error when someone’s health or life is on the line.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="316">And privacy is an even bigger issue in medicine than on social media. No one wants their medical records on display on the internet.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="317">Beam says that although there is more oversight in medicine, privacy breaches will happen.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="318">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to continue to be a problem,” he says. &#8220;The unfortunate fact in cybersecurity is that the bad guys are always just ahead of the good guys and there&#8217;s sort of an ongoing arms race.&#8221;</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="319">Despite the concerns about digital health, there’s clearly a growing interest in the combination of computer technology and medical care.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="320">Abbie Celniker, a partner Third Rock Ventures, says so far, her venture capital firm hasn’t invested directly in artificial intelligence or machine learning companies. But that day may not be far off.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="321">“We are starting to really do our homework and think about the most optimal places to bring together therapeutic development and digital health,” she says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="322">Others are investing, too. Last month, pharma giant Roche <a href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180216/NEWS/180219932">spent $1.9 billion</a> to buy Flatiron Health, a New York startup that tries to advance cancer care by analyzing huge datasets of patient records.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="323">Celniker says that most of the companies Third Rock has helped start already use digital technologies to analyze datasets, crunch numbers or improve efficiency.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="324">“But applying it in a bigger way, bringing together more diverse datasets, and having things learned from those very diverse datasets, that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re just trying now to figure out where&#8217;s the best place to investigate,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="325">Greater Boston has all the necessary ingredients to lead in the area of digital health, a number of local experts say, continuing to keep the so-called BioBoom alive for years to come.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="326">“Digital health is what&#8217;s next. Precision medicine, personalized medicine &#8212; that is what&#8217;s next,” says Bob Coughlin, president and CEO of the nonprofit Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. “Now let&#8217;s ask, where is most of that research in those areas — in digital health and precision medicine? What in gene therapy and immunotherapy and gene modification and exon skipping and CAR-T therapy, CRISPR technology &#8212; where’s most of that happening? Well, folks, you can walk to it right here.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="327">Although digital giants like Microsoft and Google are headquartered in Silicon Valley, they now have outposts in Cambridge. They’re the ones driving up the rent in Kendall Square, Coughlin says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="328">And there’s a broad range of expertise here, which will be essential for this convergence, Harvard Med&#8217;s Beam says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="329">&#8220;You can&#8217;t just be a computer scientist working in isolation on artificial intelligence if you want to change biology and medicine,” he says. You have to partner with doctors, engineers and hospital staff. “And no matter what area of biology or medicine would like you to use AI to improve, there is a world expert in that area here Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p class="speakable-paragraph">To fix or to reinvent?  That’s the question many would-be innovators ask as they contemplate potential applications of technology to health.</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist and Senior Investigator with the legendary TIMI Study Group at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s (BWH) hospital, nicely represents the views of what might be called the “fix it” folks. At a recent panel discussion at the World Medical Innovation Forum (viewable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snd0X0c_qSg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snd0X0c_qSg">here</a>), Wiviott noted how expensive traditional randomized clinical trials (RCTs) can be, telling the audience that the cardiovascular (CV) outcome trial he’s now running for an SGLT2 medication involves the recruitment of 17,000 patients, will take seven years to complete, and will cost about half a billion (with a “b”) dollars.  He suspects that it shouldn’t need to cost nearly that much, and that improved regulations in particular, as well as improving efficiencies at each step of the trial (potentially with the help of data and technology) could take 90% of the cost out of the current system.</p>

<h2>Recap | April 25</h2>
<p><strong>World Medical Innovation Forum: Artificial Intelligence</strong><br />
<em>1,700 registrants, 140 executive presenters and key leaders shape the future of artificial intelligence!</em></p>
<p>The third day of the World Medical Innovation Forum featured a series of panel discussions and fireside chats that focused on ways that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve the performance and data-gathering capabilities of medical devices, reduce health care costs, improve operational efficiencies across the healthcare system and mine new insights from clinical and research data.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the magnitude of the information we have available to us in this space, you think about where technology is today and the compute horsepower that is available to all of us, it just makes sense to continue to evaluate technologies like artificial intelligence to be able to streamline not just operational and administrative efficiency, but be able to make more informed and timely decisions,&#8221; said Eric Murphy, CEO of OptumInsight and Enterprise Growth Officer at Optum, during a discussion on how AI technologies could factor into healthcare reimbursement systems.</p>
<p>Another engaging discussion focused on the concerns that AI technologies may eventually replace human pathologists and radiologists in diagnosing patients. The message from the speakers on this panel was that AI tools should be viewed as a friend, not a foe.</p>
<p>Constance Lehman, MD, PhD, Chief of Breast Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), said AI technologies have helped make imaging services at MGH more precise, targeted and personalized while reducing repetitive tasks that lead to burnout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a doubt this is on the friend side and a really powerful technology,&#8221; said Andrew Beck, MD, PhD, CEO, of PathAI. &#8220;The types of problems we are interested in solving are really hard and big and we&#8217;re very far from being able to effectively solve them, even with the AI of today. We&#8217;re very lucky that we have the access to these new technologies that will assist the profession.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s Fireside Chat sessions provided valuable insights from healthcare leaders in the government, technology and pharmaceutical sectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in this industry for nearly four decades now. I honestly believe that I have never seen a technology that&#8217;s as transformative as this one,&#8221; said John Kelly, PhD, Senior Vice President for Cognitive Solutions and Research at IBM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity is enormous to transform this industry for better outcomes, lower costs for the benefit of all,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s now into the hard work portion of this. It is not easy to build a very intelligent, at scale, precise artificial intelligence system to be injected in the workflow of a clinical physician or a drug researcher. That is a big job. And by the way, you better have heck of a lot of good data to train that system.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Disruptive Dozen: 12 AI Technologies That Will Reinvent Care</h2>
<p>The forum concluded on Wednesday afternoon with the presentation of the Disruptive Dozen, 12 technologies that faculty members in the Partners HealthCare System (PHS) believe have the potential to significantly advance healthcare in the next decade.</p>

<h2>First Look Winners Announced!</h2>
<p>Congratulations to First Look presenters Sabine Wilhelm, PhD, from MGH and Ziad Obermeyer, MD, from Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) for winning the Peter K. Ranney Innovation Award!</p>
<p>The award was presented at last night&#8217;s Innovator&#8217;s Dinner to honor the BWH and MGH First Look presenters who embodied the innovative, entrepreneurial and visionary spirit the World Medical Innovation Forum was established to recognize.</p>
<p>Here is some of the feedback the judges provided for the winners:</p>
<h5><em>Mobile Apps: Bridging the Mental Health Treatment Gap</em></h5>
<p><strong>Sabine Wilhelm, PhD</strong><br />
The concept of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy through a mobile app reduces traditional barriers to mental health treatment and tackles cost and access issues head on.<br />
Given the well demonstrated market need for better mental health care paradigms and relative maturity of the technology, the app may benefit from a potentially short commercialization timeline.<br />
The app is well positioned to passively collect substantial data that can inform computational models used to personalize treatment and provide real-time interventions.</p>
<h5><em>A Machine Learning Algorithm to Reduce Costs and Increase Quality</em></h5>
<p><strong>Ziad Obermeyer, MD</strong><br />
The presentation addressed the kind of multi-variate clinical challenges that AI/ML based approaches are well suited to address.<br />
The research has potential for dramatic impact on both cost and quality.<br />
There is real opportunity to expand the approach across clinical domains and disease conditions-a big idea with the potential for broad impact.</p>

<h2>Recap | April 24</h2>
<p><strong>The Role of AI in Health Care Accessibility and Drug Discovery</strong><br />
<em>A closer look at how to turn the promise of implementing AI in health care into a reality.</em></p>
<p>Day 2 of the World Medical Innovation Forum was packed with in-depth discussions on the opportunities and challenges of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the health care system, with an up-close look at the role AI could play in delivering affordable health care, supporting clinical decision making, processing large amounts of data and speeding up drug development.</p>
<p>The discussion also highlighted some key challenges in AI integration, such as convincing clinicians, patients and payors of the value of AI technology, standardizing data across platforms, and protecting patient privacy in a digitized world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4332" src="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="267" srcset="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12.jpg 800w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-300x100.jpg 300w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-768x256.jpg 768w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-220x73.jpg 220w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-180x60.jpg 180w, https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12-140x47.jpg 140w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Importance of Data</h2>
<p>Data collection was a key topic in many sessions throughout the day. &#8220;The theme you will hear over and over is very high quality, well-curated data,&#8221; said Mark Murcko, PhD, Chief Science Officer of Relay Therapeutics, during a session on drug development. &#8220;One of the big challenges we have is to better represent the interactions that molecules are having. Just to tease out that little bit of insight that helps the drug discovery team move a little faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>A panel discussion on Data Engineering in Health Care emphasized the importance of engaging patients in discovery process and convincing them that the benefits of sharing their health information with clinicians and researchers outweigh the risks of a potential data breach.</p>
<p>James Mault, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for Qualcomm Life, noted that 15 years ago many people were hesitant about using their credit cards to make purchases online, but today nearly everyone has their information stored on website such as Amazon because of the convenience it provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is still there, but we&#8217;re willing to accept that risk because we&#8217;re getting these tremendous benefits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In health care we&#8217;re seeing a lot of risk, but we&#8217;re not yet seeing a lot of benefit.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Day 2 also featured a series of one-on-one fireside chats. Atul Gawande, MD, a surgeon at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) and bestselling author of Being Mortal and The Checklist Manifesto (among others), told Brigham Health President Elizabeth Nabel, MD, that the key to successfully integrating AI technology into clinical care is to identify clear benefits for both the patient and the clinician-and to ensure that the health care providers are ready and willing to use it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you give people a great process solution, the perfect innovation tool, and plug it into a ready environment, you make a major impact.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Afternoon Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>In a panel session on AI and Genetic Sequencing, moderator Heidi Rehm, PhD, said that while researchers are now able to collect much more genetic data from patients, their ability to process and take action on that data is still lagging behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team in my laboratory still reads articles in the literature to try to figure out what these variants mean,&#8221; Rehm said. &#8220;We will never be able to disseminate these technologies for broad medical use if we can&#8217;t advance what we are doing today in terms of understanding the genetic and genomic variation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the concerns raised and the work that still needs to be done, the tone of the day&#8217;s sessions were overwhelming positive, with nearly all participants saying they believed that AI technology could make significant improvements in the delivery of health care.</p>
<p>In a CEO roundtable discussion hosted by Peter Slavin, MD, President of Massachusetts General Hospital, Terri Bresenham, Chief Executive Officer for GE Healthcare, shared her optimistic outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very bullish,&#8221; Bresenham said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s no doubt that this will be by far the most transformational technology change that is going to occur, in concert with some other very important changes in genomics and genetics and biotherapies as well as diagnostics and imaging technology.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Recap | April 23</h2>
<p><strong>A Sell Out Crowd</strong></p>
<p>The fourth annual World Medical Innovation Forum (WMIF) sponsored by Partners Innovation, kicked off Monday morning with a record attendance of 1,600 participants representing the top healthcare, biotech and venture capital firms from across the globe.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s forum is Artificial Intelligence (AI), and much of the discussion on Day One focused on the promise, complexities and limitations of AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>Speakers were optimistic about the potential for AI to drive big improvements in predicting disease, treating patients and managing outcomes, but also cautioned that the technology is still in its early stages and there will likely be some growing pains along the way.</p>
<p>In her opening remarks, Anne Klibanski, MD, Chief Academic Officer of the Partners HealthCare system (PHS), noted that PHS has been investing in the large-scale aggregation and collection of clinical data that can be used to power AI technologies, and is well position to serve as an AI hub with collaborators worldwide.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker was impressed by the speakers and participants at the forum. &#8220;This is what I call rock star city,&#8221; Baker said in his opening remarks. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such a terrific collection of intellectual capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>First Look: Next Wave of AI Breakthroughs</h2>
<p>In what has become a must-see event to kick off the forum, Monday&#8217;s First Look Session provided attendees with a look at 19 new innovations in AI-powered medical applications from investigators in the PHS system.</p>
<p>The depth and breadth of applications was impressive, including innovations in psychiatry, surgery, genetic profiling, in vitro fertilization, predicting C. difficile infection rates and blood group typing, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Ziad Obermeyer, MD, an emergency medicine clinician at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH), presented a concept for using machine learning algorithm to improve the decision making process for costly medical tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing errors on both sides,&#8221; Dr. Obermeyer explained. &#8220;Predictably low risk patients are getting tested and predictability high risk patients are not getting tested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing clear to me is that anything would be better than what we are doing today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t come as a surprise to anyone that doctors make mistakes, but we can use these algorithms to find out where and with whom those doctors make mistakes. Building on this understanding, you can come to a whole range of possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Hashimoto, MD, a surgical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), presented on a system called &#8220;Surgical Fingerprints&#8221; that is designed to reduce the risk of adverse intra-operative events by collecting data from previous surgeries and using that information to guide real-time decision making in the operating room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like [the popular direction-finding app] Waze for surgery, but instead of avoiding traffic, it will allow you to avoid surgical complications,&#8221; Hashimoto explained.</p>
<h2>Discovery Café Workshops</h2>
<p>Following the First Look event, the crowd broke out into smaller groups for a series of Discovery Café Sessions taking a closer look at the potential for AI in pathology, anesthesiology, neurosciences, data security and the workforce.</p>
<p>In the neurosciences session, Maurizio Fava, MD, director of the Division of Clinical Research at MGH and the vice chair of the MGH Department of Psychiatry, noted that 20 percent of clinical trial participants never actually take the drug that is being tested,. Fava said he was hopeful that AI technology could help to identify and screen out those participants to improve the accuracy of results.</p>

<h2>Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>Monday afternoon&#8217;s panel sessions began with a big picture view of AI in healthcare before digging deeper into specific areas of interest, such as the role of AI in drug development; the interaction of AI with electronic health records and the role of AI in improving clinical trials.</p>
<p>Tom Lynch, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Bristol Myers Squibb, was optimistic that AI could help to streamline the movement of new molecules from discovery to development. The current process &#8220;takes way too long and costs way too much,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><time datetime="2018-3-21">March 21, 2018</time> &#8211; Despite the fact that the healthcare industry hit its EHR saturation point some time ago, providers and vendors are still eagerly engaged in dialogue about the utilization and continued optimization of health IT tools.</p>
<p>But the topics of debate have shifted away from how to become a digital enterprise and towards something bigger and more visionary: <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/how-healthcare-can-prep-for-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning">how to use</a> an organization’s growing data assets to measurably impact cost, patient-provider experiences, and the quality of care.</p>
<p>No discussion of these critical issues would be complete without at least a passing mention of machine learning and artificial intelligence – and for many organizations, including Partners Healthcare, these emerging strategies are at the center of the conversation.</p>
<p>“Artificial intelligence will have succeeded when we no longer talk about it,” said Mark Michalski, MD, Executive Director of the MGH &amp; BWH Center for Clinical Data Science.  “The health system will simply be smarter and better without the need to distinguish it from anything else.”</p>
<p>“But for now, it’s something that we do need to talk about because there’s so much to discover and so many opportunities to refine our thinking and our approaches.”</p>
<p>Partners Healthcare, which includes notable facilities such as Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is taking a leading role as a convener of those conversations by hosting the <a href="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/">World Medical Innovation Forum on Artificial Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>The three-day event, held in Boston on April 23-25, 2018, will bring Partners experts, Harvard Medical School faculty, and numerous luminaries from the developer and vendor community to set the expectations and potential for AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>“We are at this very exciting pivot point in healthcare, and AI is a catalyst accelerating the industry’s transformation,” says Partners Healthcare Chief Information Officer Christopher Coburn. “It isn’t going to take long at all for the effects of AI to spread across all of healthcare.”</p>
<p>Many medical disciplines are already feeling those effects, agreed Michalski.  A radiologist by training, he is keenly aware that artificial intelligence is already becoming a force to be reckoned with in image-based specialties.</p>
<p>“Machine learning has <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/ai-for-imaging-analytics-intrigues-healthcare-orgs-yet-starts-slow">tremendous promise</a> for diagnostics, including in my field of radiology,” he told <em>HealthITAnalytics.com</em>.  “It is very good at processing images, and characterizing the features in those images, to make radiologists more efficient and help them make their reports more quantitative and useful for the patients they serve.”</p>
<p>However, these early success don’t mean that artificial intelligence is going to be taking the place of pathologists, radiologists, and other diagnosticians in the near future.</p>
<p>While it is easy to get caught up in predictions of autonomous AI clinicians, Michalski suggests a bit of <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/navigating-the-hype-of-healthcare-artificial-intelligence-companies">healthy skepticism</a> about the notion that highly-trained individuals will be supplanted by machines any time soon.</p>
<p>“We’re hearing a lot in the popular press about the power of this technology, and there are articles coming out from some very smart people that say artificial intelligence will replace certain job functions or categories, which can be a little bit intimidating or even a little frightening,” he acknowledged.</p>
<p>“That comes from not yet fully understanding the boundaries of this technology and what it is really capable of doing.”</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence may be starting to get very good at classification, but human intelligence is still required to supervise AI efforts and cast a critical eye over its results.</p>
<p>“AI is very accomplished at some things, but it’s still not very good at performing other tasks,” Michalski noted.  “At the Center for Clinical Data Science, part of our mission is to define those boundaries and understand how these tools fail so we can improve them.  If AI was perfect, we wouldn’t have so much work to do every day.”</p>
<p>Instead of replacing clinicians entirely, both Michalski and Coburn believe AI will take an important supporting role.</p>
<p>“There’s a great quote that’s along the lines of ‘not all radiologists will be replaced by AI, but the radiologists who are not expert in AI will be replaced by the ones who are,’” said Coburn.</p>
<p>“AI is going to help clinicians of all types improve the things they’re doing right now.  And it will also enable some things that have never been done before. Clinicians are curious about what that is going to look like and how AI can help them become more effective and efficient.”</p>
<p>Using artificial intelligence to improve operational efficiencies and <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/can-artificial-intelligence-relieve-electronic-health-record-burnout">the EHR workflow</a> are very attractive use cases, he added.</p>
<p>“A lot of folks feel like the rise of electronic health records is coming between physicians and their patients,” he said.  “AI has the potential to reinforce the human aspect of healthcare and pull back a lot of the clumsiness of the technology interfaces we have today.  There’s a lot of hopefulness around that.”</p>
<p>Top executives and developers from a number of organizations, including Epic Systems, Change Healthcare, Optum, Nuance, Microsoft, and Health Catalyst will share their views on how to create more intuitive EHRs and more intelligent decision-making opportunities in both the clinical and operational environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://davekuhar.github.io/partners-wmif-2019/agenda/">Other sessions</a> will focus on the role of AI in drug development and precision medicine, as well as the challenges of regulating technologies that leverage brand new approaches to collecting, analyzing, and sharing big data.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see luminaries who are leading their segments of the field right now as well as folks who will be the absolute stars of their disciplines in five or ten years,” said Coburn.</p>
<p>“And there are no PowerPoints,” he added.  “We have worked hard to create opportunities for shared insights in a very rich, discussion-based format.  It’s all about communicating actionable ideas through conversations, which I think is the best way to learn.”</p>
<p>To close out the event, Partners will be putting its money where its mouth is, Coburn continued, by awarding grant funding to a series of new machine learning and AI tools developed within the Partners community.</p>
<p>“We’re going to announce the ten internal technologies that we’re going to put $50,000 against,” he said.  “That’s $50,000 each.  We’ll also be sharing our faculty’s selections of the twelve AI technologies they think will be most disruptive over the next decade.”</p>
<p>The event is designed to provide a comprehensive look at how artificial intelligence is currently used – and how it will evolve over the next few years – to significantly <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare-gets-cheaper-and-quicker">disrupt the health IT status quo</a>, said Coburn.</p>
<p>Clinicians, developers, data scientists, health IT leaders, investors, and provider executives are all encouraged to attend the crash-course in machine learning and its impacts on the industry, he urged.</p>
<p>“If you only had three days in all of 2018 to devote to AI, these would be the three days you’d want to spend doing it,” said Coburn.  “You’ll come out of there having learned what technologies are going to make the biggest impact and what areas of healthcare will be most affected by them.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be excellent preparation for making the right moves in your own organization, and we could all use as much preparation as we can get when it comes to making important decisions.”</p>

<p class="fl-post-title">Anthony Rosenzweig, MD, chief of cardiology and co-director of the Corrigan Minehan Heart Center at MGH, describes a paradox at the center of heart disease. On the one hand, the last half-century has seen a dramatic drop in death rates among patients hospitalized for a heart attack. On the other hand, survivors often go on to develop chronic conditions that are expensive and ultimately deadly. Add the aging of the world’s population and the epidemic of metabolic diseases, and heart disease remains the number one killer in the United States and most of the world, with its burden expected to increase over the coming decades.</p>
</header>
<div class="fl-post-content clearfix">
<p>The changing spectrum of heart disease has produced new clinical needs, and marshaling an effective response will require cooperation among a diverse array of stakeholders. Technology, patent insights and clinical management have combined to propel diagnosis, treatment and long term care into a new threshold. To accelerate this process, Rosenzweig and Calum MacRae, MD, PhD are co-chairing the World Medical Innovation Forum on May 1–3, 2017 to be held in Boston at the Westin Copley hotel.</p>
<p>Many top leaders from throughout the industry, government and investment communities will speak including the CEOs of a large number of leading organizations including Abiomed, AHA, Amgen, Bard, Boehringer Ingelheim, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Edwards, GE Healthcare, LivaNova, Lilly, Medtronic, Mirna, Myokardia, Philips, Siemens, Yumanity, Zafgen and Zoll Medical. They will be joined by top investors, the heads of the FDA, NHLBI and key executives from CMS and other entities.</p>
<p>This year’s agenda captures the excitement of the newly emerging chapter of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic care. It will highlight the newest approaches to treating heart failure and atherosclerosis, personal monitoring tools, breakthrough devices, metabolic syndrome, changes in pricing and policy, flexible trial design and much more. Cardiology is at the leading edge of the ongoing revolution across biomedicine and the Forum will seek to understand how this will affect every part of the translational cycle.</p>
<p>The Forum will open with twenty rising BWH and MGH stars, Harvard Medical School faculty, describing the clinical potential of their work in cardiovascular and cardiometabolic care. Discovery Café workshops will follow, led by senior Harvard faculty addressing cutting-edge cardiovascular challenges. On the final day, a panel of clinical experts from BWH and MGH will announce their selections for the “Disruptive Dozen,” the technologies likely that will have the greatest impact on cardiovascular and cardiometabolic care in the next decade.</p>
<p>MacRae describes the goal of this year’s forum as “to bring all our expertise together around the problems that our current and potential industrial partners recognize as the barriers in the future, and really think through together with these partners how we can best overcome the challenges.”</p>
<p>“Too often,” says Rosenzweig, “we are in our isolated environments and not really reaching out and interacting with our counterparts on the other side.” But, he adds, “there is no more exciting time to be in cardiovascular medicine than now. The tools we have for attacking these problems are so much more robust than they have ever been before, and the ability to merge science and clinical medicine is unparalleled. We have a large unmet need, and the hope is that industry-academic partnerships will grow out of this to move that forward.”</p>

<p class="fl-post-title">Musing over the proposal that netted him a $75 million “One Brave Idea” prize from the American Heart Association, Calum MacRae, MD, PhD, recognizing the many applicants for the grant, credits good luck and strong collaborations over ingenuity. “I think the funders were brave to give us the money.”</p>
</header>
<div class="fl-post-content clearfix">
<p>Nevertheless, MacRae, chief of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, possesses a breadth of expertise and a big-picture outlook that seem ideally suited to the purpose of the award—to support a groundbreaking idea aimed at preventing or reversing coronary heart disease. The prize is jointly funded by the American Heart Association, Google’s Verily, and AstraZenica.</p>
<p>MacRae’s aim is to develop a more complete understanding of the phenotype of cardiac disease through a combination of technological innovation and a holistic approach that views nearly every aspect of an individual’s biology as potentially relevant to the disease process. To MacRae, who runs both clinical and basic research programs studying the genetics of heart disease, “at the end of the day, genetics is the easy part; there is a single way of understanding the genomes of bacteria, conifers, humans, and everything in between.”</p>
<p>The phenotype—the various forms in which a condition expresses itself during a person’s life, starting long before there is any outward sign of illness—has received too little attention. With new dynamic phenotypes, it will be possible to improve the utility of patients’ genotypes and, in many cases, to identify the biological pathways involved in disease. With better measurement of phenotypes and the environment, and new understanding of how these enormously complex interactions lead to disease, according to MacRae, will address the rate-limiting step in modern medicine.</p>
<p>If MacRae’s proposal challenges the current cardiovascular research paradigm, that’s because the creators of the One Brave Idea prize chose to break with traditional methods of funding. Attendees were informed of the prize and given a scant four weeks to respond. Fortunately, the first-round application consisted of only four questions, each of which had to be answered in 250 words or less.</p>
<p>MacRae’s winning idea—his one brave idea, if you will—was that for the first time it might be possible to describe the phenotype of cardiac disease in a way that is precise enough, and early enough, to allow for interventions that stop it before it causes serious damage. But to do so required looking at individuals much earlier in life, and in far greater depth, than had been done previously.</p>
<p>MacRae seeks a holistic understanding of cardiac disease. In addition to studying patients’ genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes, the team will collect information on a broad range of characteristics, including features of skin, bone, behavior, and more. Though most may turn out not to be relevant to heart disease, chances are that some will, and the only way to find them is to look.</p>
<p>To illustrate where such an approach might lead, MacRae offers the example of obesity. Maybe the reason for obesity is the genetic variants that cause the disease also change the way you think about food. Or maybe they change the bacteria in your gut. We’re trying to be agnostic in the way we think about coronary heart disease. We need to think about it as a heart disease or a cholesterol disease but as a problem that we need to solve. Unless you understand the whole patient and the whole disease, it’s very difficult to understand how any individual piece of it might work.”</p>
<p>This approach would not be possible without a grant on the scale of the One Brave Idea prize. MacRae compares it to funding a startup company with its “fail-quickly” approach that supports risk-taking – “do fifty experiments, then pick the two that really work and take them across the finish line. I’m under no illusions as to how easy it will be.”<br />
After decades of medicine dominated by specialists, MacRae sees a resurgence in the role of the generalist – “but a different type of generalist, one interested in learning the fundamental rules of how everything fits together, which is made possible by new technologies and new methods of analysis.</p>
<p>The end result won’t simply be a better understanding of heart disease or even better treatment and prevention. For one thing, MacRae sees this project as overturning the way science is done. For another, it has the potential to change the doctor-patient relationship. Patient visits are shorter than they used to be, and most of the time is spent collecting data. Technology should improve collection and analysis before, during and after the appointment, freeing up time for the doctor to get to know patients on a deeper level.</p>

<h2>Highlights of the Day</h2>
<p>Day Three of the World Medical Innovation Forum was short, but was filled with some of the most exciting aspects of the meeting. The first session touched on the needs of cancer patients who require alternative strategies to achieve optimal therapeutic benefit, and the advantages and challenges associated with combination therapy.</p>
<p>The opening session was followed by a fireside chat with Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis, who provided insight into Novartis&#8217; successes and discussed current topics including CRISPR, CAR-T, a second generation of immuno-oncology, and the biggest threats to the future of innovation.</p>
<p>The morning continued with a session in which panelists discussed new cancer diagnostics driven by advances in genetics, genomics and proteomics, and the integration of these technologies into the delivery of care. This panel was followed by a discussion around the evolving role of disease-focused philanthropic foundations in patient care. For more in-depth highlights from Day Three, see below.</p>
<p>The capstone event of the Forum was the announcement of the <a href="http://cl.s6.exct.net/?qs=fc8c9e0c70cd2e56edd5b51f67c06c849eec650f884e68e52cb45eb35ed3fe5b">Disruptive Dozen</a>, the 12 technologies predicted to have the greatest impact on cancer care in the next decade. The main stage was filled with 12 influential leaders in cancer research and clinical care from Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who came together for an exciting and insightful discussion around these state-of-the-art medical technologies and what they mean for the future of the field.</p>
<p>The Forum closed with notes from Anne Klibanski, MD, Chief Academic Officer of Partners HealthCare, who noted that one of the greatest accomplishments of the Forum was the facilitation of a new community; a community that can shift paradigms and accelerate cures by having open dialogue, understanding priorities, and incorporating patient needs, expectations, and quality of life issues, and posed a challenge to the audience to maintain this dialogue even after conclusion of the meeting.</p>
<p>Next year, the Forum will focus on cardiovascular disease and will be held from May 1-3, 2017 at the Westin Copley in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.s6.exacttarget.com/lib/fe8f127274650d797c/m/1/Partners-FORUM-2016-EMAIL-TEMPLATE-160427_1732-150-2.jpg" alt="2016 World Forum" /></p>
<h2>New Philanthropy: Patients Driving Innovation</h2>
<p>As part of continued discussion around patient-driven innovation, the New Philanthropy session provided insight into the efforts of philanthropic leaders and how their community is redefining its role to develop new ways to help patients and drive breakthroughs. As disease foundations become more involved in all aspects of patient care, including the lab, clinic, engagement, and regulatory approval process, their role has evolved.</p>
<p>As gaps in funding for basic and translational research grow, these organizations have provided extensive financial support to the cancer research community, which has led to the development of breakthrough therapies and promising technologies. As Louis DeGennaro, PhD, President and CEO of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, pointed out their foundation funded the basic research that eventually led to the development of Gleevec and supported early efforts in the development of CAR-T technology at the University of Pennsylvania. Additionally, Judy Salerno, MD, President and CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, emphasized the importance of funding young investigators and remarked that, as funding has dried up, we are starving a pipeline of next-generation investigators who are needed to advance progress.</p>
<p>To provide this support, fundraising is essential, and the panel discussed the role of athletic events and social media in driving their efforts. As Dr. DeGennaro observed, cancer patients &#8220;want to win,&#8221; and athletic events such as walks, challenges, and races are a practical manifestation of that desire and are successful because &#8220;people give to people.&#8221; Supporting that notion, Billy Starr, Founder and Executive Director of the Pan-Mass Challenge, added that today&#8217;s technology allows people to reach out to their world and create bonds and opportunities that are distinct from the impact of direct mail or celebrity spokespeople. When asked about the influence of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and whether they would consider that type of engagement for their audiences, Judy Salerno, MD, President and CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, noted that their focus tends to be more directed toward the recruitment and development of people who are passionate about their mission and can become advocates.</p>
<p>To push for faster cures, panelists noted that their organizations are facilitating ongoing dialogue between patients and the FDA to address issues, concerns, and preferences, and training advocates in science to better disseminate their message. Additionally, as money raised from the Pan-Mass Challenge is donated exclusively to treatment and research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Mr. Starr also noted the patient role in the design of the Yawkey Center for Cancer Care, which was intended to advance clinical care and enhance the patient experience.</p>
<h2>Disruptive Dozen</h2>
<p>After rigorous consideration by cancer faculty from the Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the 12 technologies that are predicted to have the greatest impact on cancer care in the next decade were announced. After a short audio clip describing their disruptive technology, panelists representing each of the 12 areas enlightened the audience as to why their respective fields would have an impact on the future of cancer care in a series of sound bites.</p>
<p>Following a major theme of the Forum, and perhaps unsurprisingly, cellular immunotherapy was announced as the most disruptive technology for the next decade. Marcela Maus, MD, PhD, Director of Cellular Immunotherapy at MGH, highlighted the promise of this technology by stating that it has the potential to become a frontline cancer therapy and noting the unprecedented results seen in some patient populations thus far. However, she also noted that there are obstacles to overcome in the development of this technology for the treatment of solid tumors, which can be addressed by identifying new targets, using different engineering strategies to distinguish tumor from self, and targeting the tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>The second runner-up for most disruptive technology was liquid biopsy for oncology, and Shyamala Maheswaran, PhD, Associate in Molecular Biology, Surgery at MGH, praised the benefits of more frequent, less invasive sampling methods as compared to tumor biopsy and described the applications of this technology in early detection of cancer, monitoring of therapy, evaluation of mutational status to direct therapeutics, and assessment of heterogeneity between tumor cells for a deeper understanding of tumor evolution.</p>
<p>Coming in at number seven, genome editing was represented by Keith Joung, MD, PhD, Associate Chief of Pathology for Research at MGH. When posed the question, &#8220;how crisp are CRISPRs?&#8221; by Forum Co-Chair Daniel Haber, MD, PhD, Director of the MGH Cancer Center, Dr. Joung explained that, while limiting off-target effects at this time is a challenge, we have a distinct opportunity to develop treatments for diseases in which there are no therapies currently available and should proceed with the understanding that the technology will evolve and improve over time.</p>
<h2>Fireside Chat: Joseph Jimenez, CEO, Novartis</h2>
<p>Rounding out the fireside chat series, Joseph Jimenez, CEO of Novartis, sat down with Gregg Meyer, MD, Chief Clinical Officer at Partners Healthcare System to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes that need to take place in the &#8220;healthcare system as a whole to a platform where all patients have access to therapies&#8221;</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s &#8220;IO strategy is to be strong with second generation approaches that target the tumor microenvironment&#8221; and the &#8220;shift away from a transactional approach to outcomes-based approach&#8221;</li>
<li>The four pillars: clinical value, patient value, health system value and societal value</li>
<li>The importance of intellectual property for driving innovation &#8211; &#8220;there are no generics without innovation&#8221;</li>
<li>The relatively low cost and continuing benefits, often extending over decades, of a drug once it comes off patent should be included in discussions of drug pricing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Highlights of the Day</h2>
<p>Day Two of the World Medical Innovation Forum was brimming with fireside chats and panel discussions. The first session of the day highlighted the growing global cancer burden in which panelists from leading international companies and key government entities discussed the challenges to providing innovative technologies in diverse markets, as well as potential strategies to overcome these obstacles.</p>
<p>In the second panel, experts provided an in-depth discussion on the promise of epigenetics for cancer research, describing the complex science behind the regulation of how genetic information is processed and the development of therapies that leverage these alterations to target cancer.</p>
<p>Two panels focused on the promise of immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer, highlighting the recent burst in the field of immuno-oncology. A set of fireside chats provided insights into drug pricing, data sharing, collaboration, and patient-driven innovation.</p>
<p>The final plenary session, moderated by CNBC Biotech and Pharma Reporter Meg Tirrell, saw a panel of oncology investors discuss some of the most compelling topics in the industry today, including the most promising technologies, investment trends, comparison to other periods in cancer investing and, naturally, drug pricing.</p>
<p>The day concluded with four concurrent focus sessions, which provided discussion around radiation therapy, oncology devices, study design for personalized cancer medicine, and the unique challenges posed by increased cancer survivorship. For more in-depth highlights from some of the most interesting panels from Day Two, see below.</p>
<p>Notably, panelists demonstrated surprising candor when discussing their personal struggles with cancer, and seemed optimistic about the current trajectory of science, with the word &#8220;cure&#8221; being used more freely in the context of cancer and without reservations of this being a crazy notion, emphasizing the reality of working towards cures.</p>

<h2>Global Cancer Markets</h2>
<p>As the global cancer burden is expected to increase from 14 million to 22 million cases by 2030, panelists from leading international companies and a key governmental entity, namely the famed National Institute for Health and Care Excellence at the UK NHS, discussed the future of cancer in a global market. Moderator Sheila Dharmarajan, Head of Business Development at Zelnick Media Capital, started out by emphasizing the term &#8220;tremendous&#8221; to describe not only the prolificacy of cancer, but also to describe the complexity of the market, breakthrough technology, and the dollars at stake in terms of both pricing and cost of innovation.</p>
<p>When posed with the question of whether pharmaceutical companies should fund diagnostics, panelists acknowledged that, due to the innate differences in business models, each company must decide their own path, but Bruno Strigini, President of Novartis Oncology, also noted the importance of considering the development of targeted therapies with companion diagnostics, which can be critical to providing the right products to the right patients.</p>
<p>Additionally, Newton Crenshaw, Vice President of North America Oncology at Eli Lilly and Company, stressed the importance of symbiosis between diagnostic and therapeutic companies, and indicated that reform is needed for regulatory bodies to accelerate diagnostics and provide access to patients. Following up on this point, Gillian Leng, MD, Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Health and Social Care at NICE, stated that this relationship could be most effective if regulatory bodies were allowed to evaluate the drug and diagnostic together.</p>
<p>As technology advances and we begin to consider cancer to be a chronic rather than terminal condition, Mr. Crenshaw also posed the question of how to best support patients beyond medicine, but noted that the cost burden of long-term treatment must be considered, as well.</p>
<h2>Immunotherapy: Checkpoint Activation, Cancer Vaccines, and Cell Based Therapies</h2>
<p>Day Two featured two panels on the promise of immunotherapy in cancer treatment in which panelists discussed various approaches to leveraging the human immune system to fight cancer, including checkpoint inhibition, anticancer vaccines, and CARTs.</p>
<p>In the first session, panelists were cautiously optimistic about immunotherapy as a tool for cancer treatment and agreed that this wave of enthusiasm is still in its early stages and we must proceed by paying particular attention to the determinants of tumor response and resistance. In this context, a recurring message was the importance of tissue biopsy and biomarker analysis before and during treatment, which will be critical to the understanding of what is happening to patients at a molecular level and, as Scott Rodig, MD, PhD, Associate Professor at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, mentioned, will be extremely important in the determination of rational drug combinations going forward.</p>
<p>Similarly, panelists also stressed that we should think carefully about how we are approaching combination therapy; rather than using a shotgun approach in which we try every drug combination, we should be deliberate in understanding the underlying mechanisms to predict optimal patient populations and avoid toxicity. More specifically, Thomas Daniel, MD, Chairman of Celgene Research, stated that we should be considering the patients for which combinations are medically valuable, along with a scientific grounding for why a specific combination makes sense, which is a more tractable and financially feasible option as compared to the shotgun approach.</p>
<p>David Reese, MD, Senior Vice President of Translational Sciences at Amgen, noted that a major challenge in the field at present is a need for the development of new surrogates for traditional response criteria; as patients live longer and overall survival becomes increasingly difficult to measure, some trial designs will essentially become intractable.</p>
<p>The second immunotherapy panel discussed what&#8217;s next for CAR T-cell therapy, with Usman (Oz) Azam, MD, Global Head of Cell and Gene Therapies Unit at Novartis, referring to the current technology to as &#8220;version 1.0.&#8221; Panelists discussed the promise of CART in hematological malignancies, but as Mark Frohlich, MD, Executive Vice President of Portfolio Strategy at Juno Therapeutics, pointed out, we must still determine the right targets for solid tumors.</p>
<p>When quizzed about the future of the technology, Dr. Azam also mentioned that gene therapy could be utilized to take CARTs to the next level, which Chuck Wilson, PhD, CEO of Unum Therapeutics, expanded upon by suggesting that the use of gene editing to target specific genes, create allogeneic T cells, or inhibit signaling pathways, could support the work of CARTs.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson also reminded the audience that the reality is, as an autologous cell therapy, the logistics of taking cells from the patient, manufacturing cells, and returning them to the patient, will be inherently more costly than other therapies, but that scalability could bring this cost down. Additionally, as Marcela Maus, MD, PhD, Director of Cellular Immunotherapy at MGH, pointed out, the development of point-of-care methods or &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; T cells that could treat many patients with one lot are potentially less costly.</p>

<h2>Fireside Chat Roundup</h2>
<p>The first two days of the Forum were filled with fireside chats, which allowed for an intimate perspective on pricing, the importance of data sharing, academic and industry collaborations, current healthcare challenges, and much more.</p>
<p>Kicking off the first fireside chat of the Forum on Monday evening, Richard Gonzalez, CEO of AbbVie, sat down with Nancy Snyderman, MD, Medical Advisor, GE Healthymagination, to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The acquisition of Pharmacyclics and the &#8220;blind dating process&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Doubling down on R&amp;D&#8221; to bring a consistent stream of good medicines</li>
<li>Catering to patients by &#8220;bringing improvements for standard of care&#8221; that the healthcare system would reward</li>
<li>The most important model today of &#8220;partnering with academic and biotech&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s lineup of fireside chats started with Amgen&#8217;s CEO Robert Bradway and Bloomberg&#8217;s biotech reporter Caroline Chen on a variety of topics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need &#8220;to collaborate outside of your organization, especially with cancer&#8221;</li>
<li>The costly price tag that comes with innovation but &#8220;the need to focus on the benefit that it brings for society&#8221;</li>
<li>Project Data Sphere, an independent and not-for-profit initiative of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer&#8217;s Life Science Consortium (learn more here).</li>
<li>A call to society to invest more in cancer prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>With nine months left on the job, Andy Slavitt, Acting Administrator for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), spoke candidly with CNBC&#8217;s biotech and pharma reporter, Meg Tirrell on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for new payment models because governments don&#8217;t have &#8220;magic pots of money&#8221; and &#8220;we are still in the 1st and 2nd generation of pricing models&#8221;</li>
<li>Finding new ways to care for the &#8220;most difficult people with the lowest income and are disconnected from the healthcare system&#8221;</li>
<li>Pilot programs for cost containment and spurring innovation focused on &#8220;doubling down on primary care and prevention&#8221;</li>
<li>The qualifications for the next CMS administrator &#8211; &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need the job, doesn&#8217;t see it as a stepping stone, doesn&#8217;t need to make friends, and has struggled to find and provide care&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Praising the industry for its strides in finding important cures for cancer, Bristol-Myers Squibb CEO, Giovanni Caforio, MD, started off his chat with Meg Tirrell by highlighting three critical points to being a leading company in oncology: keeping the patient at the center, following the science and collaborations with industry and academia. Other topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need for &#8220;different payment models and flexibility in the healthcare system&#8221;</li>
<li>The &#8220;beginning stages of understanding why patients don&#8217;t respond to immunotherapies&#8221;</li>
<li>The need to focus on biomarkers as &#8220;they are really important&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Rounding out today&#8217;s fireside chats, &#8220;patient scientist&#8221; Kathy Giusti, Founder of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium, spoke with Nancy Snyderman, MD, to discuss her journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a patient advocate, patient and business disruptor who has elevated attention and propelled advancements for multiple myeloma</li>
<li>The need for data sharing for research and cures</li>
<li>The &#8220;tough lifting&#8221; that comes with trying to stay on top of the cancer landscape</li>
<li>Partnership with Harvard Business School to &#8220;put together a business plan by which business and science could start disrupting&#8221; and &#8220;to bring the absolute best-in-class to ask the tough questions and to share and solve the problem&#8221;</li>
<li>How she made the decision to stop her own treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>Day One of the World Medical Innovation Forum began with a wave of young investigators highlighting promising developments in cancer research in a series of rapid-fire presentations. Recurring themes of the First Look session included the use of RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) as a diagnostic tool, liquid biopsies for exosome analysis, and precision medicine approaches to patient care. Multiple presentations also highlighted the capabilities of the AMIGO suite at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, which uses intraoperative imaging to guide precise localization and analysis of patient tumors during surgery.</p>
<p>Attendees then had the chance to liaise with established Harvard Medical School faculty over lunch during the Discovery Café session, which paired interested Forum-goers with renowned leaders in their respective fields. Nearly 30 faculty members covered topics such as immunotherapy, diagnostics, therapy resistance, and the potential of CRISPR for research and therapeutics.</p>
<p>The Forum plenary opened with David Torchiana, MD, CEO and Anne Klibanski MD, Chief Academic Officer of Partners HealthCare, who welcomed an audience representing more than two dozen countries and introduced a program filled with high-caliber speakers and hot topics including immunotherapy, epigenetics, and bioinformatics. They emphasized the importance of collaboration to accomplish the goal of providing better care and support to cancer patients and their families and noted that the &#8220;engine of innovation is running better than ever&#8221; as we seek to push the boundaries of the many diseases collectively known as cancer.</p>
<p>After a series of thought-provoking sessions, Astellas Pharma announced the launch of the inaugural C3 Prize<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. The day culminated with inspiring remarks from Greg Simon, Executive Director, The White House Moonshot Initiative and a fireside chat with Richard Gonzalez, CEO of AbbVie (stay tuned for more about the Forum&#8217;s fireside chats in tomorrow&#8217;s Day Two recap). For more in-depth highlights from some of the most interesting panels from Day One, see below.</p>
<h2>A War or Moonshot: Where Do We Stand?</h2>
<p>In the first panel of the day, Nancy Snyderman, MD, Medical Advisor at GE Healthymagination, sat down with Monica Bertagnolli, MD, Chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, and Daniel Haber, MD, PhD, Director of the MGH Cancer Center to discuss what&#8217;s to come in a new era of cancer research and care. The panelists were tasked with advising on whether cancer research and care over the next decade will be a war or a moonshot. Panelists agreed on both perspectives &#8211; a war because, from a patient perspective, it is a personal battle against disease and we must come together as an army to combat the disease and work effectively towards a cure, and a moonshot because progress in cancer happens with huge steps forward and reflects the combined efforts of a large group of people working toward a common goal, much like landing on the moon.</p>
<p>When asked about the funding landscape and future of academic research and development in oncology, Dr. Bertagnolli noted that, when money is tight, teamwork must be utilized, and support from patient organizations such as Stand Up To Cancer is profound. Dr. Haber also noted that we are at a magic time during which so much science is being translated, but that funds are also needed for basic research, with the rationale that, if all money goes to translational research and we do not value basic discovery, then there will be nothing to translate in the coming years.</p>

<h2>Creating a Disruptive Cancer Pipeline and Winning Portfolio Strategy</h2>
<p>A focus of Day One included cancer pipeline and portfolio development, which began with a panel discussion of how to build and maintain a successful pipeline in a challenging environment. Panelists including Keith Flaherty, MD, Director of Clinical Research at the MGH Cancer Center, and Sean Harper, MD, Executive Vice President of Research and Development at Amgen, commenting on company culture and regulatory oversight of clinical trials.</p>
<p>Jay Bradner, MD, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, noted that we may not be able to visualize what a cure for cancer will look like at this time, as technologies are still emerging, but that we should beware of paradigms, as they can sometimes make you blind to the next breaking wave.</p>
<p>In a discussion of clinical trial participation, panelists stressed the need for improved navigation of study information for patients, which would in turn facilitate the interactions between these patients and their physicians and potentially improve recruitment. It was also noted that these patients should have access to expert opinion on the best trials for their disease; as George Demetri, MD, Director of the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute noted, it should not be so much easier to find the best Chinese restaurants on &#8220;Dr. Google&#8221; than it is to find the best clinical trial.</p>
<p>Panelists discussed the need for improved infrastructure that would hasten the timeline from ideas to clinical trials and noted that the FDA is responsive to novel approaches and is looking to industry and academia for advice. Dr. Demetri also noted that such an idea is on the table, with the proposed creation of an Oncology Center of Excellence at the FDA.</p>
<p>Overall, panelists indicated that the pharmaceutical industry is receptive to insight from academia, and that the field appears to be aligned in the early drug discovery mission. In a discussion of the interactions between small companies and big pharma, panelists noted that the small companies tend to be very innovative, but investments are risky. Sean Harper, MD, noted that pharma tends to be very open to bringing assets in to their pipeline, but would rather engage early on to ensure that it&#8217;s a good product, and that takes engineering.</p>

<h2>Curative Therapies: The Economics of Game-Changing Science</h2>
<p>As novel, potentially curative cancer therapies come to market, drug pricing has emerged as one of the hottest topics of discussion. Speakers shared their insights on the balance between affordability and continued innovation in the healthcare industry, which was emphasized by Betsy Nabel, MD, with the notion that we need to provide the &#8220;right treatment for the right patients at the right time&#8221; while making it affordable.</p>
<p>Speakers included Troy Brennan, MD, Executive Vice President and CMO of CVS Health, Paul Hudson, President of AstraZeneca US, Betsy Nabel, MD, President of Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, Gary Reedy, CEO of the American Cancer Society, and Peter Slavin, MD, President of Massachusetts General Hospital. The panel was moderated by Sue Siegel, CEO of GE Healthymagination.</p>
<p>In the session, panelists discussed how to measure the effectiveness of a treatment. Dr. Slavin noted that we are facing much more economic pressure in healthcare and that it is critical to eliminate care that doesn&#8217;t help our patients. Panelists suggested that the private sector, including commercial payers, academic medical centers, pharmaceutical industry, biotech, venture, and pharmacy should come together to determine the value framework, rather than leaving it to CMS.</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson noted an inherent risk associated with developing medicines, and that the demand for breakthroughs and targeting of smaller patient populations has never been higher, while Dr. Nabel reminded us that companies must also consider the costs associated with innovation, as well as the hidden cost for future development if innovation is left behind. Panelists suggested that pharmaceutical companies, insurance providers, and pharmacy benefit management companies should come together to share risk, as all parties would be incentivized if the risk is broadly distributed.</p>
<p>When asked about when cancer will become a chronic disease, a majority of the panel agreed that it would be within 10 years, while one panelist noted that, in some patient populations, the time is now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BOSTON&#8211;(<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)&#8211;Partners HealthCare today announced that the upcoming <a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedforum17.wpengine.com%2F&amp;esheet=51318971&amp;newsitemid=20160413005469&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=World+Medical+Innovation+Forum%E2%84%A2&amp;index=1&amp;md5=a27680c0a6877335e7f9d91c7424fec9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">World Medical Innovation Forum<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> will include a focus on patient care, ranging from discussions of the importance of cancer prevention and early detection and the innovations that are making it possible to the unique care requirements and new technology approaches to help survivors. The 2016 Forum, an annual collaboration and partnering event held in Boston on April 25-27, will focus on cancer. CEOs and senior company executives, top investors, policy experts, and Harvard scientists leading the charge in the fight against cancer will take the stage over the course of the three-day Forum for a series of sessions that will critically examine the innovations in and evolution of cancer care.</p>
<p>“Technological advances in diagnostics are beginning to make it possible to detect cancer at the earliest stages of the disease when treatment may be most effective,” said David Louis, MD, Pathologist-in-Chief, Massachusetts General Hospital and Benjamin Castleman Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School. “However, there have been many barriers to making these innovative tests widely available to patients, including the need for more research and development to ensure accuracy, better guidance to speed the regulatory process and new models to support their value and reimbursement. This Forum provides a space for us to learn about these exciting new diagnostic technologies and to collaborate on the scientific and economic challenges that preventative strategies and early cancer detection bring about.”</p>
<p>“Detecting cancer as early as possible in the developmental stage will help both patients and hospitals in terms of prognosis with possible cure or therapy regimens before the cancer has spread. It will also help avoid the economic burden typically associated with late-stage detection,” said Massimo Loda, MD, Senior Pathologist, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Principal Investigator, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School. “The technologies we are creating and pursuing are designed to detect and pursue cancer cells at the most vulnerable point in their development: the very beginning. The Forum will provide us with the opportunity to discuss those advances and learn of other new developments in a collaborative manner.”</p>
<p>The prevention of cancer and the development of new strategies to detect cancer precursors and early-stage malignancies when treatment may be most effective – clinically and financially — are critical research goals. The experts on the “<b>Early Detection and Prevention of Cancer</b>” panel will review powerful imaging modalities, single-cell analysis of the tumor microenvironment and next-generation cancer models. They will also discuss circulating tumor DNA testing to monitor response to treatment and emergence of cancer resistance—with the objective of early cancer diagnosis before symptoms appear. The panel will take place at <b>4:50 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</b></p>
<p>Panel participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Moderator: <b>David Louis</b>, MD, Pathologist-in-Chief, MGH and Benjamin Castleman Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><b>Andy Chan</b>, MD, Program Director, Gastroenterology Training Program, MGH and Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><b>William Hait</b>, MD, PhD, Global Head, Janssen Research &amp; Development</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><b>Krishna Kumar</b>, CEO, Emerging Businesses, Philips</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><b>Massimo Loda</b>, MD, Senior Pathologist, Principal Investigator, BWH, Dana-Farber and Professor, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School</li>
</ul>
<p>“The number of people diagnosed with cancer is continuing to grow at an astounding rate and while new treatment advances are enabling more and more of these patients to survive, there is an increasing need for innovative tools and resources to address the changing needs of patients, their families and the health care system,” said Claire Thom, Pharm D, Senior Vice President, Global Oncology Development, Astellas.</p>
<p>Extraordinary treatment advances have turned many cancers from apparent death sentences into manageable chronic illnesses with extraordinary consequences for the entire health care system. In the United States, there are approximately 14 million cancer survivors, up from just three million four decades earlier. Those survivors have unique care requirements, that will put enormous stress on the system and calling out for new technology solutions. A program, titled “<b>Surviving Cancer: New Realities, New Needs</b>,” will discuss those requirements and the technologies and approaches that can help monitor, guide, and connect patients. The panel will take place at <b>4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 26, 2016, in the Takeda Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</b></p>
<p>Panel participants include:</p>
<ul>

<p>BOSTON — March 23, 2016 — Partners HealthCare today announced that highlights at the upcoming World Medical Innovation ForumTM will include the global economics of cancer care. The 2016 Forum, an annual collaboration and partnering event held in Boston on April 25-27, will focus on cancer. CEOs and senior company executives, top investors, policy experts, and Harvard scientists leading the charge in the fight against cancer will take the stage over the course of the three-day Forum for a series of sessions that will critically examine the changing economic cancer-care landscape.</p>
<p>Novel, potentially curative cancer therapies are coming to market, with the promise of unprecedented patient benefits. While most key stakeholders have recognized the cost effectiveness of curative therapies, these therapies also present a challenge to payers in terms of the potential spike in patient volume and high cost as many of these innovative cancer therapies are being introduced. The “Curative Therapies: The Economics of Game Changing Science” panel will bring together top executives from the pharma, foundation, pharmacy, and provider sectors to explore cost effectiveness as part of regulatory approval. They will also examine the increasing emphasis on early detection, shifting incentives for oncologists, and how integrating billing codes, bundled payments, and management fees can help bring drug costs down. This panel will take place at 3:10 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</p>

<li>Peter Slavin, MD, President, MGH and Professor of Healthcare Policy, Harvard MedicalSchoolAccording to the American Cancer Society, cancer causes 1 in 7 deaths worldwide and is rapidly becoming a global epidemic. If rates don’t change, the World Health Organization predicts that the global cancer burden will increase from 14 million new cases and 8 million cancer-related deaths worldwide to 22 million cases and 13 million deaths by 2030.“The shift to treating cancer as a chronic disease and the multitude of new treatments and technologies available to health care providers are impacting the financial aspect of cancer treatment,” said Marc de Garidel, Chairman and CEO, Ipsen, the global specialty-driven pharmaceutical company. “The issue is treated differently from country to country and there are many lessons to be learned from the outcomes of each approach.”
<p>To kick off the program on Tuesday, expert panelists from leading international companies and key governmental entities, including the famed National Institute for Health Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom, will discuss how approaches to deliver innovative technologies differ in various international markets, what the respective drivers are, and the requirements and challenges that must be met. The program, titled “Global Cancer Markets,” will focus on key strategies and trends in the international market and will begin at 8:15 a.m. on Tuesday, April 26, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.</p>

<p>Forum keynoters include the CEOs of Novartis, BMS, Amgen and Abbvie who will join more than 100 total speakers &#8212; all experts in new cancer technology from industry, the investment community and Harvard Medical School. World Forum attendees include senior executives, investors, entrepreneurs, clinicians and scientists. The focus of the Forum is new cancer technologies and the cooperative innovation among industry, academia, government and philanthropy required to make them happen.</p>
<div class="bw-release-story">
<p>“Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. Developing new means of treating and diagnosing cancer requires an active collaboration between clinicians, scientists, companies and investors to identify and address patient needs,” said Daniel Haber, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Cancer Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. “The outcomes of this cooperation will ultimately affect the lives of patients worldwide.”</p>
<p>Over the three days, the 2016 Forum will highlight emerging cancer innovations in immunotherapy, epigenetics, early diagnosis, combination therapies, as well as curative drugs, cancer markets, the role of patients in innovation, cancer as a chronic disease and investment strategies.</p>
<p>The Forum is co-chaired by Daniel Haber, M.D., Ph.D., and Monica Bertagnolli, M.D., Chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School. Academic speakers include Harvard Medical School-appointed clinicians and investigators from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>“The recent advances in the targeted treatment of cancer are extremely exciting and have set the stage for us to understand cancer biology as never before,” said Monica Bertagnolli, M.D. “While the progress in treating patients has been encouraging, cancer is a large and diverse group of diseases and it is continually evolving, making the need for innovation constant if we are to achieve our goals of prevention and cure. Pushing boundaries back requires collaboration across sectors.”</p>
<p>A highlight of the Forum is a showcase of the most promising cancer technology innovations from around the world &#8212; the 12 technologies with the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and patient care over the next decade. The final selections, called “The Disruptive Dozen,” will be announced on the last day of the Forum. Another highlight will be rapid fire presentations by emerging cancer research stars. The “First Look: Next Wave of Cancer Breakthroughs” session will kick off the Forum at 8AM Monday April 25.</p>
<p>The World Medical Innovation Forum is organized by Partners HealthCare Innovation, a division of Partners HealthCare dedicated to advancing the commercial application of the unique capabilities of Partners’ academic medical centers. “The breadth of the topics that will be covered and the commitment to interdisciplinary engagement from international leaders across academia, finance, industry and public policy makes the Forum an unrivaled, must-attend event,” said Chris Coburn, Partners Vice President for Innovation and conference organizer.</p>
<p>Sponsors of the Forum include Novartis, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Takeda, Amgen, Astellas, General Electric, Ipsen, AstraZeneca, MacDougall Biomedical Communications, Ropes and Gray, Mintz Levin, McCall and Almy, and Vertex.</p>

<p>Right now, for example, that involves being named in a lawsuit over the future of health care reform before the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>But Burwell can escape the anti-Obamacare vibes for a bit on her upcoming visit to health reform-friendly Massachusetts.</p>
<p>She is among an elite group of health and science leaders who will speak next month at the <b class="b">W</b><b class="b">orld Medical Innovation Forum</b>, a new event sponsored by <b class="b">Partners HealthCare.</b></p>
<p>Partners, the system that includes<b class="b"> Massachusetts General</b> and <b class="b">Brigham and Women’s</b> hospitals, developed a program featuring a list of headliners who are at the forefront of research and innovation. The list of speakers includes high-profile local chief executives: <b class="b">Jeffrey Leiden</b> of Boston’s <b class="b">Vertex Pharmaceuticals</b>, <b class="b">Michael Mahoney</b> of Marlborough-based <b class="b">Boston Scientific</b>,<b class="b"> Deborah Dunsire</b> of Watertown-based <b class="b">Forum Pharmaceuticals</b>, and from Cambridge, <b class="b">David Meeker</b> of <b class="b">Genzyme,</b> and <b class="b">George Scangos</b> of <b class="b">Biogen Idec.</b></p>
<p>Also on the schedule is <b class="b">Ann Romney</b>, who is the wife of the former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate, and an ambassador for multiple sclerosis patients.</p>
<p>Brigham last year named its <b class="b">Center for Neurologic Diseases</b> for Romney, who was diagnosed with MS in 1998.</p>
<p>The innovation forum, slated for April 27 to 29 at the <b class="b">Westin Copley Place</b> hotel, will be centered on neuroscience.</p>
<p>Of course, being sponsored by the state’s biggest health system, the event will include plenty of speakers with Partners on their name tags.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BELMONT — Ann Romney knows a lot about political campaigns. Win or lose, there’s one thing you gain for sure: a network of people with an awful lot of money.</p>
<p>They couldn’t put her husband, Mitt, in the White House, but she’s now hoping everyone will get behind her to launch the <a class="a" href="http://www.bwhannromneycenter.org/">Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases</a> at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Her goal is to create a new model for research and funding, setting out to raise $50 million over the next year to help find treatments and cures for five conditions: multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Lou Gehrig’s (ALS), Parkinson’s, and brain tumors.</p>
<p>The Romneys are seeding the center with what Ann calls a “substantial gift.” And I trust that it is big. Before Mitt’s two failed presidential bids and before he served as our governor, he made a fortune as founder of Bain Capital, the Boston buyout firm.</p>
<p>This is hardly a vanity project for Mrs. Romney. She has lived for 16 years with MS, a chronic disease of the immune system in which nerves deteriorate, causing symptoms as severe as paralysis. Her doctor, Howard Weiner, is at the Brigham and the idea for a new center came two years ago following a routine visit. Romney’s MS, initially treated with steroids, has been in remission for more than a decade and is now managed by a healthy diet and exercise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="435">For the first time, and to the astonishment of many of their colleagues, researchers created what they call <a class="meta-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Alzheimer's Disease." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/alzheimers-disease/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Alzheimer’s</a> in a Dish — a petri dish with human brain cells that develop the telltale structures of Alzheimer’s disease. In doing so, they resolved a longstanding problem of how to study Alzheimer’s and search for drugs to treat it; the best they had until now were mice that developed an imperfect form of the disease.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="479" data-total-count="914">The key to their success, said the lead researcher, Rudolph E. Tanzi of <a title="More articles about Massachusetts General Hospital" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/massachusetts_general_hospital/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> in Boston, was a suggestion by his colleague Doo Yeon Kim to grow human brain cells in a gel, where they formed networks as in an actual brain. They gave the neurons genes for Alzheimer’s disease. Within weeks they saw the hard Brillo-like clumps known as plaques and then the twisted spaghetti-like coils known as tangles — the defining features of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
